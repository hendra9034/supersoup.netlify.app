<ol>
<li>Prepare the seasoning for the rice. Wash and rinse the rice until the water runs clear. Set aside until broth from chicken can be added to cook the rice.</li>
<li>Clean the chicken with a small amount of coarse sea salt and rub all over getting rid of any loose skin and dirt. Rinse off salt from the chicken and pat dry with a kitchen towel, it should now be glistening.</li>
<li>Now massage the chicken generously inside and outside using fine sea salt. Stuff the chicken with the ginger slices, garlic and spring onions.</li>
<li>Place the chicken in a large stockpot and fill with cold water to cover above by 1 inch. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat. Scum will form and the impurities need to be removed. Add the chicken herbal mix, along with the rice wine, powdered chicken stock, light soya sauce, spring onion stalk, ground white pepper, sesame oil and salt (optional). Stir to incorporate all of the ingredients.</li>
<li>Reduce the heat to low to simmer the chicken slowly. If any further scum forms, remove the impurities. Simmer for about 30. Now taste the broth and amend taste as necessary (add more soya sauce, white pepper, salt etc).</li>
<li>I use a rice cooker to make my rice. For the amount of cups used, use a 50/50 ratio of water and chicken broth ladled into the rice pot. Place pot in the rice cooker and cook the rice on normal setting. Alternately, use a saucepan to cook the rice until all the stock water is absorbed and steamed.</li>
<li>In the meantime while the chicken and rice is cooking, make the ginger and spring onion oil sauce. Combine the chopped ginger and spring onion in a bowl and add the  - vegetable oil, sesame oil, salt, a little soup stock and mix.</li>
<li>Pour out the chilli sauce dip into a small serving bowl. Slice the cucumber and place it onto the table along with both the dipping sauces.</li>
<li>Add the mooli to the pot and cook until soft and translucent. Cook chicken for a further 20 minutes (depending on the size of the chicken). To check if the chicken is cooked insert a sharp knife into the flesh under the leg the thickest part of the thigh to see if the juices run clear. If it runs clear, the chicken is ready.</li>
<li>When the chicken is cooked through, lift and transfer the chicken onto a large plate. Discard the onion, ginger and green onion stuffing. Carve or shred the chicken for serving and place in a large onto a large serving bowl. Place in the middle of the table so everyone can serve themselves.</li>
<li>Check on the rice and using a rice spatula, fluff up the rice and taste it to see if it is at desired texture. Then serve the rice into individual bowls.</li>
<li>In individual soup bowls ladle the broth.</li>
<li>Serve and eat the sliced chicken with the bowl of rice, soup, dipping sauces, sliced cucumber (optional) and half an boiled egg (optional).</li>

Khao man gai or khao mun gai, literally meaning oily rice [with] chicken, is one of the most popular Thai dishes; it can be found everywhere in Thailand from It is originally from Hainan, China. In Thailand, khao man gai is served with cucumbers, chicken blood tofu, coriander, and a bowl of soup.
