<p>Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to make a special dish, lentil soup with sausage. It is one of my favorites. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Lentil Soup with Sausage is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. Lentil Soup with Sausage is something which I have loved my whole life. They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>Lentil soup flavored with sausage and herbs. Serve with Romano cheese sprinkled on top of each serving bowl. I love the sausage and lentil soup at Carrabb's Grill and always wish I would be able to get the recipe. Well, I thought this came extremely close.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook lentil soup with sausage using 14 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script async="async" data-cfasync="false" src="//pl15720023.effectivecpmgate.com/2f3369bfcc5e95034f3d2d243a25891b/invoke.js"></script>
<div id="container-2f3369bfcc5e95034f3d2d243a25891b"></div>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-lentil-soup-with-sausage">The ingredients needed to make Lentil Soup with Sausage:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take 1/2 cup Olive oil</li>
<li>Make ready 4 large Links Sweet Italian Sausage</li>
<li>Get 2 medium carrots sliced</li>
<li>Take 4 clove garlic sliced</li>
<li>Make ready 1 cup brown lentils rinsed</li>
<li>Take 2 bay leaves</li>
<li>Prepare 28 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>Take 6 cup water</li>
<li>Get 4 cup shredded swiss chard or kale</li>
<li>Get 1 Grated pecorino ramano</li>
<li>Get 2 stick celery sliced</li>
<li>Get 1 medium onion diced</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Salt &amp; Pepper</li>
<li>Get 1 Crushed red pepper</li>
</ol>
<p>The sausage's flavors are reinforced by adding more garlic and pepper to the soup itself, for pops of flavor. Pleasantly firm but creamy on the inside, Beluga lentils (also known as black lentils) are worth seeking out for this hearty soup because they hold their shape when cooked, adding a lovely texture. This delicious, hearty lentil soup made with sausage, carrots, potatoes, celery, and spices is perfect for warming you on those cold winter nights. What's more, it's easy to make, economical and very satisfying.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-lentil-soup-with-sausage">Steps to make Lentil Soup with Sausage:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Heat 1/4 cup olive oil (enough to coat bottom of pot) in a large pot on medium heat. When hot, add the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon until it starts to brown, about five minutes. Add the onion, celery, carrots, first two garlic cloves, a pinch fo salt, and if you like your soup spicy, a pinch of red pepper flakes. Cook with the sausage until the vegetables soften a bit, another 5 minutes. Add the lentils, bay leaves, tomatoes, water (6 cups is, conveniently, 2 empty 28-ounce cans, so you can get any tomato pulp you missed), more salt and black pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and allow to cook until the lentils are tender, about 40 minutes. (It might be necessary to add more water if the soup gets too thick, though we preferred ours on the thick side.)</li>
<li>When the lentils are cooked, add the chard and cook until the leaves are tender, just a few minutes more. Discard the bay leaves.</li>
<li>To finish, divide soup among bowls, then add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 garlic cloves to a small skillet and heat over medium until the garlic softens and hisses. Drizzle this over soup bowls, and top with fresh Romano, passing more at the table. Leftovers will keep for several days in the fridge.</li>
