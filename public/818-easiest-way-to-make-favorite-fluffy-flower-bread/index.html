<li>Mix the milk (lukewarm), sugar and yeast in a standing mixer. You can kneed this with your hands, but for me this is the easiest way. Let them stand for 5 min and then add the eggs, oil, yoghurt and salt.</li>
<li>Mix and then gradually add the flour. My dough needed exactly 550g but depending on your flour and eggs, it may require a bit less or a bit more. You need a dough that is soft and can be easily removed from the bowl (it won't stick)</li>
<li>My bowl is big, so I leave the dough in there, cover with a cellophane and let it rise for 30-60 min, until it's double in volume.</li>
<li>Divide your dough in 4 pieces. Take the first one and roll it out into a circle, around 3mm thick. Spread some oil on it.</li>
<li>We do the same for the other 3 pieces, putting each one on top of the other. Roll out the dough, spread with oil, put on top of the previous one and continue. Don't put oil on top of the last one.</li>
<li>Place a circular cookie cutter in the middle, or a bowl, or a glass&hellip; Using a sharp knife, cut the dough from the glass to the edge of the circle into quarters. Cut each quarter in half to give you eight sections.</li>
<li>Take each section and twist it twice. Make sure you twist all the sections in the same direction</li>
<li>Put it in your pan and let it rise again until double. Whisk an egg with a bit of water and brush the top of the bread with this. Sprinkle with some sesame seeds.</li>
<li>Bake in a preheated oven, 180ºC, until it gets a nice golden colour and if you knock it on the bottom you get a hollow sound (as if you knock on a door). About 40-50 min.</li>
