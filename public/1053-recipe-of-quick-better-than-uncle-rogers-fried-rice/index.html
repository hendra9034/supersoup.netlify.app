<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-better-than-uncle-rogers-fried-rice">The ingredients needed to make Better Than Uncle Roger’s Fried Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready 4 cups leftover overnight cooked rice - long grain rice is best for fried rice - I.e. bhasmati</li>
<li>Get 1 Chinese sausage (optional)</li>
<li>Get 4 teaspoons dried shrimp (optional)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 medium size onion</li>
<li>Make ready 5 cloves garlic</li>
<li>Make ready 1 sprig spring onion</li>
<li>Make ready  Vegetables of your choice (optional) - preferably solid ones like root vegetables. I’m using carrot and also red capsicum. Good for adding additional fiber and vitamins to the dish</li>
<li>Take 4 eggs - rule of thumb - 1 egg per cup of rice - be generous</li>
<li>Make ready 1 teaspoon chili flakes (optional) or you can also use crack pepper</li>
<li>Make ready  Sauces - 4 tablespoon light soy sauce, 4 teaspoon fish sauce (optional), sesame oil (optional), butter or ghee (options)</li>
<li>Prepare  Cooking oil - preferably ones that can have smoke point like vegetable oil or peanut oil</li>
<li>Get  Cooking utensils</li>
<li>Prepare 1 wok - but if you don’t have one, a deep frying pan will also do</li>
<li>Make ready 1 decent spatula</li>
</ol>
<p>His opposition to the stove was pointless. The BBC woman did the wet method, that is something that is new to me, and as an American I'll Why does fried rice at restaurant taste so much better than the ones I make at home? Uncle Roger then quickly segues into the shooting location of Ramsay's cooking video, quipping that it looks like a deserted island, referring to the movie Castaway, but for egg fried rice. But Uncle Roger praises Ramsay for cooking outside, making a connection with how Asians have two kitchens - a wet.</p>

<ol>
<li>Prep all your ingredients - small dice cutting all the vegetables, loosen up the rice, and put all the sauces next to the wok (for easy access when you are stir frying the rice). Pro-tip: add dried shrimp and Chinese sausage to take your fried rice to the next level! To prep in advance, steam the Chinese sausage before removing the skin and dicing it up. As for the dried shrimp, soak it in hot water for 2-3 minutes to remove any salty briney flavour. Drain the shrimp before use.</li>
<li>Prep the eggs but beating them up. I usually like to add a dash of milk or water to soften up the eggs. Then heat up your wok. Don’t add any oil until you see the wok smoking up, a.k.a. “Wok-Hey” in the Cantonese dialect. Once, it’s smoking hot, add the cooking oil. Swirl the oil to coat all over the wok.</li>
<li>Pro-tip: be a little bit generous with the cooking oil, I used about 6-8 tablespoons of cooking oil. Once the wok is super hot, add in the egg and stir constantly so it doesn’t burn. And when it’s 70%-80% cooked, remove from wok. You should have a super fluffy “omelet” like egg.</li>
<li>Once you’ve taken out the fluffy egg, in the same pan add a little bit of sesame oil and throw in your dried shrimp and cook till fragrant (1-2 minutes). Then add in your vegetables (garlic, onion, carrots) with the butter and chili flakes. Cook until the garlic and onion releases its fragrant (1-2 minutes).</li>
<li>Then add in the rice, red capsicum, Chinese sausage and fluffy egg. Continue to stir fry until the rice are loosen and all ingredients are mixed properly. Then add the soy sauce and fish sauce. Don’t forget to taste the food. Remember that the ingredients such as the shrimp, sausage, butter, sauces all have saltiness. Pro-top: Only add salt if it’s not salty enough. Don’t add anymore soy sauce as it may make the fried rice too wet.</li>
<li>Finally, add in the spring onion. Give it a final stir before serving it up. The shrimp, Chinese sausage, soy sauce and fish sauce all have a decent umami flavour so you don’t need to add any msg - monosodium glutamate.</li>
