<p>The Denver steak is an excellent example of a lesser known cut that deserves some recognition! A great alternative to the New York Strip, this steak is full of intramuscular marbling, fat and flavor. The reverse sear method works very well with American Wagyu, given its vast intramuscular marbling. Denver steaks are one of the increasingly popular steaks that come from the chuck primal. They're relatively tender, with nice beefy flavor, and they usually feature a good amount of marbling.</p>
