<p>Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we&rsquo;re going to prepare a distinctive dish, broccoli blue cheese soup. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Creamy Broccoli and Cauliflower Soup with Blue Cheese. This Soup recipe is so easy to make and extra special because this is my Mom's recipe and I love. I have been making broccoli cheese soup for years but this version is MUCH easier!! Broccoli and blue cheese soup is classic British cooking, and especially good for using up any leftover cheese from Christmas.</p>
<p>Broccoli blue cheese soup is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes delicious. It is appreciated by millions every day. They are fine and they look wonderful. Broccoli blue cheese soup is something which I have loved my whole life.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook broccoli blue cheese soup using 14 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-broccoli-blue-cheese-soup">The ingredients needed to make Broccoli blue cheese soup:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  Ingredients</li>
<li>Make ready 2 cube (or tsp) chicken stock</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 pinch ground cumin</li>
<li>Prepare 1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
<li>Prepare 1 pinch cajun seasoning or cayenne pepper</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tbsp wheat flour</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tbsp corn flour</li>
<li>Take 60 grams blue cheese</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 carrot or parsnip</li>
<li>Get 30 grams butter</li>
<li>Make ready 150 ml heavy cream</li>
<li>Prepare 4 cup hot water</li>
<li>Prepare 1 head Broccoli (or 2)</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 cup dried potato flakes</li>
</ol>
<p>In a Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium-low heat. This soup is great for fall and winter, has light, creamy texture and is loaded with flavors. I know that pretty much anyone can make a cream of broccoli soup, I just added some blue cheese croutons to make mine extra special. It is even good for the coming holidays, even though there is no pumpkin in it.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-broccoli-blue-cheese-soup">Instructions to make Broccoli blue cheese soup:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Wash and Cut the broccoli head and carrot or parsnip finely</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a sauce pan and add the carrot finely chopped until butter begins to Brown</li>
<li>Add finely chopped broccoli head and 2 cups water. I like to cut the outer 'skin' off the stalk and add the soft part off the stalk finely chopped also, but leave it out if you want. Feed the scraps to your rabbit if you have one.</li>
<li>Add a generous amount of pepper and the chicken stock. add the wheat flour</li>
<li>Bring to boil for 10 minutes and use a potato masher to mush things up a bit. This step determines the texture of your soup so leave it boiling longer for a thicker smooth soup our shorter for a crunchy thinner soup.</li>
<li>Add the rest of water and corn flour, add spices and reduce heat.</li>
<li>Once it's on a gentle simmer to avoid splitting, add cream and blue cheese.</li>
<li>Add remaining seasoning and potato flakes. Taste the soup to see if anything is missing for your preferences.</li>
<li>This should easily feed 2 hungry people. Double the recipe for left-overs to freeze or have up to 2 days later (the taste will get stronger).</li>
<li>Hopefully your wonderful wife is just pulling the flatbread out of the oven about now (mine sure was). Serve and enjoy</li>
