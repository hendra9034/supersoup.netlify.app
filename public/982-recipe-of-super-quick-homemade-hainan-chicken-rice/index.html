<li>There should be enough water in the pot so that the chicken doesn’t touch the bottom of the pot, as that will cause the skin to tear. Lift the chicken in and out of the water a couple of times to change the liquid in the chicken’s cavity.</li>
<li>If you have poultry hooks, use them to hang the chickens in the pot. The water should now be steaming but not bubbling. Keep the heat low at this level and cook the chicken for 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Using the poultry hook (or slotted ladle), carefully lift the chicken out of the pan, ensuring you don’t break the skin, and plunge into a large bowl or sink of salted iced water.</li>
<li>Reserve the stock and stand the chicken in the iced water for at least 10 minutes, turning once. This will stop the cooking and give the skin its delicious gelatinous texture.</li>
<li>Remove from the iced water and hang over a bowl or the sink to drain well. Rub the skin all over with the sesame oil. The chicken should be cooked very lightly, pink inside the bones and with a gelatinous skin.</li>
<li>To make the chicken rice, pound the garlic and eschallot (or onion) to roughly bruise with a mortar and pestle.</li>
<li>Combine the rendered chicken oil with vegetable oil to make ½ a cup of oil. Heat in a wok over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger stir until starting to brown, then strain through a sieve.</li>
<li>Reserve the oil and discard the solids. Place the rice in a rice cooker or heavy-based saucepan. Add about 1.2L of the reserved stock from the chicken (strained) and the reserved flavoured chicken oil (or use the proportions as indicated on your rice cooker).</li>
<li>Tie the pandan leaves in a knot (if using) and add to the rice. If cooking in a pot, bring to the boil over high heat and continue to boil for about 5 minutes until the level of the liquid reaches the top of the rice, then reduce the heat to very low, cover the pan with a tight fitting lid and cook for 12 minutes, then remove from the heat and stand for another 10 minutes.</li>
<li>For the dressing, combine the ingredients with about half a cup of the stock from cooking the chicken. When the rice is ready, use a cleaver to slice and debone the chicken Chinese-style and pour the dressing over it.</li>
<li>Scatter with the coriander sprigs, and serve with sliced cucumber, tomato and serve with the rice and sauces.

This three-in-one dish (chicken, rice, and soup) originated in Hainan, a tropical island off China's Remove fat from cavity of chicken and reserve for rice. Hainan chicken rice isn't called that there, and it's not served the way we've come to expect it Hainan chicken rice as we know it actually has its claim to fame in Malaysia and Singapore. Place the chicken trimmings into a saucepan over medium-high heat and cook for. Hainan chicken rice is a chicken dish originated from, you guessed it, Hainan (Southernmost province of China), and is a variation of their well know dish called 文昌雞 WenChang chicken.</p>
