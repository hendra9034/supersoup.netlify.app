Historically, the dish has also been prepared using other meats, such as rump steak and lamb's kidney.

<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook toad in the hole using 15 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<ol>
<li>Heat the oven to 200c.</li>
<li>First to make the batter, whisk the eggs and milk together, then add the flour and season with salt and pepper. Leave to rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat a pan or oven tray in the oven. Then add the fat/oil and place back in the oven. Oil should be piping hot so leave in the oven to heat for 6-8 minutes.</li>
<li>Carefully add the sausages to the hot oil, and brown on all sides by turning them as needed, but don't cook through.</li>
<li>Ensuring the oil is piping hot carefully pour the batter over and around the sausages (batter should start curling and cooking around the edges if the oil is hot enough).</li>
<li>Cook for 30-35 or until cooked through, batter should have risen and be nice and golden brown on top.</li>
<li>Serve with choice of vegetables or mash and Gravy. I served mine with carrot and potato mash and boiled sweetcorn topped with onion gravy.</li>
<li>To make the gravy: First dissolve the stock cube in the water. Next heat the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and add the onions, fry until soft. Then add the flour and stir until its fully absorbed. Add the mustard and sugar. (note: recipe calls for 1 tsp but I used 1 tbsp a I didn't read the recipe properly but still turned out really good and I also added 1 tsp of brown sugar). Then add the stock to the saucepan.

Usually in America it refers to an egg cooked in the hole cut out of a piece of bread. I wasn't quite satisfied with that recipe, and based on feedback from readers and a bit more. American Toad in a hole is one of the first recipes I had my children prepare when they were learning to cook. Much easier than the European version, this fun egg-in-a-hole is sure to please.</p>
