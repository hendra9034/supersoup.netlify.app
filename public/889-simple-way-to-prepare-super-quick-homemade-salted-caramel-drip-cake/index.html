<h5 id="instructions-to-make-salted-caramel-drip-cake">Instructions to make Salted Caramel Drip Cake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>For the Cake: 1) Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan and line three 20cm/8inch sandwich cake tins with baking parchment - leave to the side</li>
<li>Next, In a stand mixer, beat together the butter and light brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add in the flour, eggs and baking powder and then beat again until combined - try not to over beat (if mixture is really thick add the milk to loosen it up)</li>
<li>Divide the mixture evenly between the three tins and smooth over the top - bake for 25-30 minutes until the Cake is golden and the skewer comes out clean (the Cake should spring back)</li>
<li>Once cooked leave the cakes to cool in the tin for about 10-15minutes and then remove to the wire racks to chill for another 10-15minutes (if cakes dome slightly leave the cakes to cool upside down)</li>
<li>For the Decoration: 1) In a stand mixer beat the butter until it is smooth and loose, then beat in the icing sugar 1/3 at a time. Keep beating in the icing sugar until it has all gone and the icing is fluffy and fully combined. Then beat the icing for another 5-6minutes so it becomes fluffy and light</li>
<li>Next add in the carnations caramel and beat again with a pinch of sea salg for 3-4minutes. Taste it and if it is salty enough leave it but if not add a little more salt and beat again</li>
<li>Once all three of the cakes are cooled, put the first layer on the serving plate (I used a spinning cake stand to make it easier to ice) spread 2tbsp of the icing on the top of the first layer and spread it around evenly. Do this for the other two layers but don't put icing on the top of the top layer yet</li>
<li>With the left over icing spread a thin layer all around the Cake including the top (this is the crumb layer) refrigerate for 10minutes then add a thicker layer of icing. Smooth over the icing to make it neat (make sure you don't use all the icing, leave enough to go round the middle of the cake in a circle(see picture at the top))</li>
<li>Once the icing is all done put the rest of the carnations caramel in a heat proof bowl with a pinch of salt. Beat it hard and then put in the microwave for 10seconds</li>
<li>Using a piping bag, pipe the caramel around the edge of the cake to create the drip, don't use to much for the drip because it will fall quite far with one drop</li>
<li>Pipe the rest of the icing around the inside (where you started the drip) once this is done pour the rest of the carnations caramel inside the circle of the buttercream. I then added rolos and grated some chocolate to the Cake but you can use what you like</li>
<li>Once this is done refrigerate for about 15minutes and then it is ready to serve! Enjoy ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹</li>
