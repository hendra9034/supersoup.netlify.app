<li>Scald your rye flour and seeds by boiling 400g water and allowing to cool for 5 minutes. Then pour over the rye flour and seeds. Cover with cling film (when cooled) and leave overnight. I generally start my sourdough first thing in the morning. Start by pouring the olive oil and filtered water in your mixing bowl, add your levain and mix well. Then add the scalded flour and mix in well. Add the very strong white flour and mix roughly.</li>
<li>Cover and leave in a proofer @ 27°C or in a warm room for 30 minutes. Next add the salt and mix in. Leave in the proofer for 40 minutes then stretch and fold 4 times. Repeat this every 40 minutes. Total time in the proofer - 4 hours. Split your dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each loaf and place in bannetons which have been coated in rice flour and cover. Back in the proofer for 1.5 to 2 hours. Then place in a fridge @ 2°C for the afternoon and overnight.</li>

If you have a cast iron Dutch oven, place 5 or 6 ice cubes around the dough.</li>
<li>If you are a relative newcomer to the art of sourdough baking, have a look on YouTube for stretching and folding techniques and shaping dough. - Vary your seed combinations and herbs to your liking.
