<h5 id="steps-to-make-melt-in-the-mouth-braised-bbq-beef-ribs-cooking-method">Steps to make Melt In The Mouth Braised BBQ Beef Ribs (Cooking Method):</h5>
<ol>
<li>Firstly you need to marinade your beef short ribs in the BBQ dry rub, and make up the BBQ sauce in a saucepan, then once you're ready to cook them, preheat your oven to 160 (fan).</li>
<li>Lay the marinated short ribs meat side down in a sided baking tray then pour your BBQ sauce all over. The sauce will slide off the bone sections a bit, but don't worry about that. Cover tightly with foil then cook for 2.5-3 hours. Low and slow is key here. If your beef ribs are particularly large and meaty please note you may need to cook them a little longer than this, but this was more than enough for the ones I had.</li>
<li>Remove the foil and baste the ribs well all over with the reduced down BBQ sauce, getting into all the crevices. You may notice that quite a bit of oil has seperated here in the tray, don't worry this will reduce down on the next step. Cook for a further 20-30 minutes without the foil. The ribs should now be a deep brown and a little caramalised at the edges.</li>
<li>Remove the ribs carefully when removing from the baking tray as they'll easily fall apart. Mix up the remaining BBQ sauce in the tray and give them a generous final basting. The ribs will be melt in the mouth tender and you'll be able to pull the bones out clean. Enjoy! :)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds like you need braising steak. The longer you marinade, the more Heat and time would depend on the size, how you are cooking it etc. BBQ Braised Ribs are tender pork baby back ribs (aka braised short ribs) in pineapple juice and sticky bbq I have a collection of my favorite braised recipes because it's a slow hands-off method with most of its work done in the oven or pot! Cooking tender beef ribs, just get a whole rack of beef short ribs (don't bother with beef back ribs) thaw them out and make a rub, try sea salt, pepper, Johnny's, cumin chili powder, accent and brown sugar, rub the rack, wrap it in foil and store in the fridge over night, next morning set the ribs out to. Beef ribs can be both tough to eat and difficult to prepare.</p>
