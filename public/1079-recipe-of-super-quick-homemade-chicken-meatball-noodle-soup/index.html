<li>Begin by sweating the onions and garlic in some oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Once softened add the celery and carrots and saute for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Take the seared meatballs and place them in the pot. Allow to simmer for two or three minutes.</li>
<li>As the soup simmers add the noodles and chopped kale and stir. Cook the noodles for seven to eight minutes or until they are cooked through.</li>
