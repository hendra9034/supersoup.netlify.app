<p>Hello everybody, it&rsquo;s me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, home recipe cabbage wraps. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Home recipe cabbage wraps is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. Home recipe cabbage wraps is something that I have loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>This is a delicious recipe for traditional cabbage rolls. In summer when tomatoes are plentiful, I use peeled fresh tomatoes instead of canned diced tomatoes to reduce the sodium. Stuffed cabbage wraps get an Asian-inspired twist in this recipe full of fresh ingredients. This recipe makes a large batch for a Paleo-friendly crowd pleaser.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook home recipe cabbage wraps using 20 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<ol>
<li>Take 1 whole Savoy cabbage</li>
<li>Prepare 500 g pork mince (can use other meats this is just my preference)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 small handful of chopped green onions</li>
<li>Get 1 onion minced/finely diced</li>
<li>Prepare 2 large garlic cloves minced/finely diced</li>
<li>Take 1 medium carrot thinly sliced/cut with mandoline</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 red bell pepper finely diced</li>
<li>Get 1 teaspoon minced ginger</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 cup dark soy sauce</li>

</ol>
<p>Plus, unlike many traditional cabbage wrap recipes, these are cooked on the stovetop rather than baked in the oven.
