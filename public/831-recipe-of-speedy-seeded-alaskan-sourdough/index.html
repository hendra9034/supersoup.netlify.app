<ol>
<li>Prepare 750 g very strong white flour</li>
<li>Get 250 g scalded Einkorn flour**</li>
<li>Make ready 200 g Alaskan levain</li>
<li>Take 60 g virgin olive oil</li>

<li>Make ready 40 g linseed</li>
<li>Prepare 20 g chia seeds</li>
</ol>

</script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-seeded-alaskan-sourdough">Instructions to make Seeded Alaskan Sourdough:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Scald your Einkorn flour and seeds by boiling 500g water and allowing to cool for 5 minutes. Then pour over the Einkorn flour and seeds and mix really well. Cover with cling film (when cooled) and leave overnight. I generally start my sourdough first thing in the morning. Start by pouring the olive oil and filtered water in your mixing bowl, add your levain and mix well. Add the scalded flour and seeds and mix well.</li>
<li>Add the strong white flour and mix roughly. Cover and leave in a proofer @ 27°C or in a warm room for 30 minutes. Next add the salt and mix in. Leave in the proofer for 40 minutes then stretch and fold 4 times. Repeat this every 40 minutes. Total time in the proofer - 4 hours.</li>
<li>Next morning take 1 banneton from the fridge and allow your dough to reach room temperature (1 hour). Pre-heat your oven to 220°C, slash your dough and place in your cloche/Dutch oven for 22 minutes with the lid on and 20 minutes with the lid off. If you have a cast iron Dutch oven, place 5 or 6 ice cubes around the dough. Take your 2nd banneton out of the fridge 15 minutes before you have placed your 1st loaf in the oven and repeat the process.</li>
<li>Split your dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each loaf and place in bannetons which have been coated in rice flour and cover. Back in the proofer for 2 hours. Then place in a fridge @ 2°C for the afternoon and overnight.</li>
<li>If you are a relative newcomer to the art of sourdough baking, have a look on YouTube for stretching and Folding techniques and shaping the dough.</li>
<li>Vary your seed combinations and herbs to your liking. I vary the flour I use - Spelt, Khorasan or rye (80g to 100g) but always at least 350g very strong white flour. Vary the water content to get a more open crumb texture but the dough becomes a lot more difficult to handle the higher the hydration.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Why scald flour? It will give you a loaf of bread that is more moist and will last longer! - Also if you’re keen to make bread with a flour that has lower levels of gluten than wheat flour, for example rye, barley or buckwheat, scalding is the method to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
