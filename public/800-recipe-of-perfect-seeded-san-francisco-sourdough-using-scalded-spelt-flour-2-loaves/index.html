<ol>
<li>Scald your spelt flour and seeds by boiling 600g water and allowing to cool for 5 minutes. Then pour over the spelt flour and seeds and mix really well. Cover with cling film once cooled and leave overnight. Make your levain by mixing together 100g bottled water, 100g strong white flour and 16g of San Francisco starter. Cling film the levain and leave overnight at room temperature.</li>
<li>I generally start my sourdough first thing in the morning. Start by pouring the olive oil and filtered water in your mixing bowl, add your levain and mix well. Add the scalded flour and seeds and mix well. Add the rest of the flour and sage and mix roughly. Cover and leave in a proofer @ 27°C or in a warm room for 30 minutes. Next add the salt and mix in. Leave in the proofer for 40 minutes then stretch and fold 4 times. Repeat this every 40 minutes. Total time in the proofer - 4 hours.</li>
<li>Split your dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each loaf and place in rice flour coated bannetons. Cover and put back in the proofer for 1.5 - 2 hours. Then place in the fridge @ 2°C for the afternoon and overnight.</li>
<li>Next morning take 1 banneton from the fridge and allow your dough to reach room temperature (1 hour). Pre-heat your oven to 240°C for 1 hour (with your bread pan/cloche in). Turn your oven down to 220°C. Slash your dough and place in your bread pan for 22 minutes with the lid on and 21 minutes with the lid off. If you have a cast iron bread pan/ Dutch oven, place 5 or 6 ice cubes around the dough to create steam. Same procedure for your second loaf.</li>
<li>If you are a relative newcomer to the art of sourdough baking, have a look on YouTube for stretching and folding techniques and shaping dough.</li>
<li>Why scald flour? It will give you a loaf of bread that is more moist and will last longer. Useful if you are using flour with lower levels of gluten than wheat flour, for example rye, barley, buckwheat or spelt.</li>
