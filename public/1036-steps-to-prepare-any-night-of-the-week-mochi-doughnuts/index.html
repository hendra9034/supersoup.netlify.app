<ol>
<li>Mix all ingredients to make a dough. If it is too soft, you can add a little bit extra Flour. Knead well until smooth. - *Note: I used this Glutinous Rice Flour that is available from most supermarkets in Melbourne</li>
<li>Roll the dough into small balls, about 2cm in diameter. If you use 6 balls to form a doughnut, you would need 36 balls. It is your choice to use 8 balls for each doughnut. In that case, make 48 balls.</li>
<li>Prepare 6 x 10cm square pieces of baking paper. Arrange the balls on each baking paper and form a ring.</li>
<li>Heat deep Oil about 160℃, carefully place the dough with the baking paper into the Oil. As the paper will come off, carefully remove the paper, and fry the doughnuts for 4-5 minutes or until nicely golden on both sides.</li>
<li>Transfer to a wire rack, and repeat with remaining dough.</li>
<li>My Mochi Doughnuts are best when they are just fried and still warm.</li>
<li>If you want to add Icing, mix Icing Sugar and 1 tablespoon liquid until smooth, dip one side of the cooled doughnut in the Icing, then leave on the wire rack until the Icing is dry to touch.</li>
</ol>
