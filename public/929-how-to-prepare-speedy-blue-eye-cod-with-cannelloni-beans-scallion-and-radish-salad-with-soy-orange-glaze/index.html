When all the vegetables are blanched and drained, mix them together in a covered container and refrigerate for up to day.</li>
<li>For longer storage, spread the drained brunoise on a tray and place the tray in the freezer until frozen. Store the frozen brunoise in a well sealed plastic bag in the freezer. You can use the brunoise directly from the freezer in the recipes where it is warmed before serving.</li>
<li>Brunoise, what we call tiny dice of staple vegetables, is used often as a garnish.</li>
<li>For the Cannelloni: -  - Combine cannelloni, tomato diamonds, brunoise, and unsalted butter in a pan and heat over low heat. Keep warm.</li>
<li>To complete: -  - Heat the orange glaze to a simmer and whisk in the butter piece by piece. Add the soy sauce and keep the glaze warm.</li>
<li>Drain the iced vegetables and toss them with chives and a small amount of lemon oil.</li>
<li>For the blue eye cod: -  - Heat about 1/8 inch oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the fish with salt and white pepper. Add the fish fillets skin side down and cook for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, occasionally pressing down on the pieces with a spatula to help brown the skin.</li>
<li>Flip the fillets and “kiss” (just briefly cook) the other side, then remove the fish from the pan.</li>
<li>To finish: -  - Place 1 to 2 tbsp of the orange glaze in the center of each plate. Place about 1 to 2 tbsp of Cannelloni mixture in the center of the glaze, allowing it to spread into the glaze.</li>
<li>Place the fish skin side up over the beans. Gently place a small pile of the crips salad on one end of each fish fillet and serve.</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite way of cooking fish is to pan fry it just for a few minutes and finish it off in the oven. Grouper with Fingerling Potatoes, Scallion Radish salad, and Soy-Orange Glaze. Serve the cod and salad with the remaining dressing on the side. All Reviews for Steamed Cod with Ginger and Scallions. Steamed Cod with Ginger and Scallions.</p>
