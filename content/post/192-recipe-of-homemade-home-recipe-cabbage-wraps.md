recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the onions in a pan (use oil or an alternative, when they get warm I like to add water to prevent burning) until soft. Then remove and allow to cool"
- "Add all the ingredients into a bowl and mix until well combined."

- "Take out of the steamer, let sit for a couple minutes so they don&#39;t burn your mouth off, and serve (the 3 dips I did were little homemade ones that I made up, ones tangy tomato, ones a concoction of spy sauce, honey etc and the other is the same as the latter but with spice)"
