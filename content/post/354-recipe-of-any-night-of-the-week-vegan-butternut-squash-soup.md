recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 medium onion"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "2 pounds butternut squash peeled seeds removed and cubed"
- "1 teaspoon sea salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper"
- "1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves We also used sage and ginger"
- "1 1/2 cups vegetable broth"
- "2 cups Silk Original Almondmilk"
- "2 teaspoons lime juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large stock pot, heat the olive oil over medium high heat until shimmering."
- "Add in the butternut squash, stir to combine, and sauté for about 7 minutes until the butternut squash releases some flavour and the onions become translucent."
- "Add in the salt, pepper, thyme, vegetable broth, almond milk, stir to combine."
- "Bring to a boil and then to a simmer for another 10 minutes, until the butternut squash becomes fork tender. Test it with a fork to ensure it is properly cooked through."
- "Remove from heat. Pour the soup into a large blender. Now add the lime juice into the blender too. If you&#39;re not using a large blender (holds at least 6 cups) then do this in increments. Using the soup setting on your blender, or a very powerful blend option, blend until creamy and smooth. My blender automatically blends for about 3 minutes continuously. OR, you can use an immersion blender and puree the soup ingredients until combined and smooth."
- "Taste and add salt and pepper to taste if necessary."
- "Serve into bowls and top with garnish - I love extra nutmeg, parsley and a bit of extra almond milk or a touch of coconut milk on top (OPTIONAL)."
