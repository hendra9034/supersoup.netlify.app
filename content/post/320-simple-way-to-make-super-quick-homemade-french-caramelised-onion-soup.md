recipeingredient:
- "50 grams butter"
- "4 white onions thinly sliced"
- "1 tsp garlic paste"
- "100 ml non alcoholic white wine or alcoholic white wine"
- "1 litre good quality beef stock"
- " Small french baguette"
- "1 garlic clove to rub on croutons"
- "100 grams grated gruyere cheese"
- " Salt and pepper"
- " Chopped parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the butter in a wide saucepan (this gives to onions space to caramelise beautifully) and gently fry the onions and garlic paste over a very low heat for as long as time allows....to get the best flavour out of this dish, never rush it and just be patient."
- "Add your white wine to loosen your caramelised onions, bring to the boil and add your beef stock. Simmer gently. Make your croutons by slicing the baguette into thick portions, toast the bread both sides and rub with a clove of slightly crushed garlic. Under the hot grill melt your cheese, I like mine just on the point of melting, but it’s down to your preference."
- "Taste your soup for seasoning, add salt &amp; pepper to your liking. Ladle the soup into bowls, place your croutons on top and scatter with fresh chopped parsley."
