- "12-16 thick cut rashers of smoked streaky bacon"
- "1/2 cup (100 g) brown sugar"
- "1 tbsp. Dijon mustard"
- "2 tbsp. red wine"
recipeinstructions:
- "Line a baking tray with parchment or use a roasting rack (it will go quicker on the rack). Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Arrange the bacon in the tray in a single layer – you may need to do it in batches. Bake for about 20-25 minutes until crisp."
- "In the meantime mix the glaze ingredients together. When the bacon is ready, remove it from the oven, drain the fat from the tray and brush the rashers with the glaze on both sides. Return to the oven for 10 minutes, or until the glaze is dark brown and bubbling."
- "Transfer to a wooden board or fresh sheet of parchment and leave to cool – it should not be tacky to the touch. To serve, cut in halves or thirds. Keep in the fridge on a plate in a single layer, covered loosely with cling film."
