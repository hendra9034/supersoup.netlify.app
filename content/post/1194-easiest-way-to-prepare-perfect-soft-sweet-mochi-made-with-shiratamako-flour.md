- "100 g Shiratamako Japanese Glutinous Rice Flour"
- "200 ml Warm Water"
- "100 g Caster Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- " Potato Starch Flour"
- " Tsubuan Sweet Azuki Paste           see recipe"
recipeinstructions:
- "Spread plenty of Potato Starch on a chopping board (OR a tray), on which you will place cooked Mochi later. You would need extra Potato Starch."
- "Place ‘Shiratamako’ Flour in a heat-proof mixing bowl, gradually add Warm Water, mixing well. Add Sugar and Salt, and mix well until smooth."
- "Heat in the microwave for 40 seconds, take out and stir with a spatular, then heat 1-2 minutes or until cooked. *Note: When the colour becomes slightly transparent (not white), it is cooked."
- "*Note: I used 1100W microwave. Depending on the power, alter the cooking time. You can steam the mixture in a large heat-proof bowl for 10 to 15 minutes."
- "Clean the spatular with warm water, and use the wet spatular to stir the mixture very well. *Note: As the mixture is very sticky, wet the spatular with warm water when required."
- "Using the wet spatular, take the thick and sticky ‘Mochi’ onto the prepared board. Sprinkle extra Potato Starch over the ‘Mochi’ as well. Use a rolling pin (OR your hands) to flatten and roll it out to a large oblong about 5-6mm thick."
- "Remove excess Potato Starch from Mochi and cut into 5cm x 10cm oblongs. Place 1 tablespoonful of Tsubu-an (Sweet Azuki Paste) on each piece, then fold in half. *Note: This ‘Soft Sweet Mochi’ can be enjoyed as it is without Azuki Paste."
