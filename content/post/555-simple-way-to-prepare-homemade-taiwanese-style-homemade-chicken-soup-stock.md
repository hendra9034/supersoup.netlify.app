- "Once it starts to boil, cover the pot and lower the heat to medium-high heat. Continue to cook for another 45 minutes."
- "You can add some salt to taste or leave it as is and season it later when you use the soup stock for other recipes. Make sure to take out the bones and veggies before storing your soup stock. You can keep it in the refrigerator for up to a week. Or freeze the soup stock so it can last longer."
