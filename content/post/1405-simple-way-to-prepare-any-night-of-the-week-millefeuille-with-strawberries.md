recipeingredient:
- "1 puff pastry ready rolled"
- "5 spoons icing sugar"
- "12-16 strawberries in thin slices"
- "12-16 strawberries finely chopped"
- " For the cream"
- "250 ml heavy cream 3536 fat"

- " The seeds of 1 vanilla stick"
- "1 egg"
- "3 egg yolks"
- "20 gr corn starch"
- "20 gr flour"
- "1 pinch salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Thin the puff pastry sheet out with a rolling pin whilst using some icing sugar to make it a bit sweeter. Place it between baking paper and then bake it in the oven in a tray with heavy item on top of it (I used a baking tray on top) so that the layers stick together. Bake it for about 20mins at 180deg C. When the puff pastry is done, cut it with a sharp knife immediately while it’s still hot in pieces of 6cm wide/ 12cm long and put them aside."
- "While the pastry is being baked, put the cream, the milk and the vanilla in a pan under medium heat. At the same time, in a bowl mix the 3 egg yolks, the egg and the sugar. Then, add the flour, the corn starch and the salt in the egg mixture and stir well till it becomes homogenous."
- "Now, when the milk mixture is warm enough (but not boiled), take some of the milk mixture with a ladle and pour it gradually in the eggs mixture while stirring constantly. Repeat this 2-3 times and then pou the eggs mixture back in the pan over medium heat. Stir constantly with a whisk till the mixture gets thickened and transformed in a velvety cream patisserie (it takes about 5-10mins)."
- "Transfer the cream in a clean bowl and place some cling film on top of the cream so no air is in between and let it cool. When the cream is in room temperature, transfer it in a piping bag."
- "Cut the strawberries in slices and in pieces as described above."
- "Take one piece of the puff pastry and place it in the middle of the plate and do 2 pipings all the way down from top to the bottom and then place a layer of strawberry slices on top. Then, place another puff pastry on top and repeat the process. I made 3 layers but i found it too much, so I suggest you make 2 layers of cream."
- "Before placing the top pastry layer, dust icing sugar on it by using a fine sieve. Then place it on top. Lastly, draw as a perfect circle as possible with the chopped strawberries as shown in the photo. Enjoy!!"
