recipeinstructions:
- "Add the flour to a bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour. Rub the butter into the flour with your fingers until there are no lumps left"
- "Add the egg to the bowl and mix roughly with a fork. Mix some more in the bowl with your hands until the mixture comes together as a dough. Turn out onto a kitchen surface - lightly dust with flour to prevent it sticking when you roll the pastry."
- "Roll the dough out until you have enough to cover your tin. Make sure the tin is lightly greased with oil/butter, and fill the tin with your pastry mixture - you might need to make sure the pastry sits to the edges on the inside. Cut any loose pastry away from the top edge of your tin."

- "Line the pastry with baking paper and weigh down with baking beads. If you don&#39;t have baking beads you can blind bake with some dried beans. Blind bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baking beads and bake for another 3-4 minutes until the pastry is golden brown"
- "Add the filling ingredients to a bowl and mix with a spoon. Pour the filling into the pastry, don&#39;t worry if the mixture is runny at this stage is will firm up when cooked."
- "Bake for 30 minutes. When you remove from the oven it may be wise to leave to cool for a few minutes as the filling will be very hot! Serve with clotted cream or ice cream. Leftovers are delicious cold as well"
