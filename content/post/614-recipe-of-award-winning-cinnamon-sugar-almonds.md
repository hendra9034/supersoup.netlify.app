recipeingredient:
- "1-1  12 cups Roasted Almonds"
- "1/2 cup Sugar"
- "2 teaspoons Cinnamon"
- "1/4 Cup Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place all ingredients in a saucepan and cook on medium heat."
- "The dark colour liquid is getting thick and it soon starts looking like caramel. This stage you worry when to stop cooking because the caramel would quickly become sticky like toffee. Do not worry and keep cooking stirring."
- "Does it really look like caramel? It’s not caramel. It’s OK to keep cooking."
- "When you keep cooking, the caramel-like liquid starts turning to dry sugar-like. That’s the point to decide when to stop. You can stop cooking when all almonds are well coated. Place them on baking sheet and cool."
- "*Warning: After the thick dark caramel-like liquid turned to dry sugar-like, if you still keep cooking, the sugar starts to melt and turn to real caramel. Caramel coated almonds are very nice, but they stick to each other and they are not easy to handle. You might end up spending hours to clean up the saucepan. (I have done that!)"
