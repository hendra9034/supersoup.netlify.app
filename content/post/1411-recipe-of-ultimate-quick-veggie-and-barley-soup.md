recipeingredient:
- "1 cup or so chopped celery"
- "1 cup or so chopped onion"

- " To taste salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse off barley or Job&#39;s tears, then put in a sauce pan and cover with water by a few inches. Bring to a boil and then let simmer for 45 minutes or so (I cook the grain separately so it doesn&#39;t absorb all the liquid in the soup)."
- "In a bowl, dissolve the stock cube in the 1/2 liter of water and set aside."
- "In large sauce pan, saute the celery, onion, and carrots in the olive oil over medium heat."
- "When the veggie mix is softened, add in the stock, tomato paste, and celery seeds. Bring to a boil, and then let simmer."
- "After ten minutes, add the dill and the corn starch slurry. Stir to make sure the slurry is thoroughly mixed."
- "Let the soup simmer another ten minutes or so until it achieves desired consistency (mine was thickened just a bit - runny but not watery)."
- "Remove from heat and season to taste."
- "When barley/Job&#39;s tears are done (should be mostly soft, maybe a little al dente), strain to eliminate excess water and then add to the soup. Reheat if necessary and serve."
