recipeingredient:
- " Salad Leaves"
- "2 Heads Romaine Lettuce"
- "1/4 Iceberg Lettuce"
- "4-5 tbsp Caesar Salad Dressing"
- " Salt and Pepper to taste"
- "2-3 tbsp Grated Parmesan or hard cheese"
- "2 tsp Capers"
- " Tofu"
- "300 g Firm Tofu"
- "4 Tbsp Breadcrumbs"
- "1 Egg"
- "50 ml Frying Oil"
- " Croutons"
- "1 Medium Ciabatta Loaf or 23 slices of white bread"
- "3 tbsp Olive Oil"
- "2 tsp Salt Flakes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Open and drain the tofu. Press the tofu using chopping boards and placing a weight on top of it (cooking books are good for this). Leave to stand for an hour."
- "Meanwhile, prep the croutons. Preheat the oven to gas mark 6. Cut the bread into medium bite-size chunks. Toss the bread pieces with olive oil and salt and bake for 5-10 minutes until they are crisp. Shake the croutons halfway through cooking to make sure they cook evenly."
- "Prep the salad. Wash and roughly chop the salad leaves. Place in a bowl with a tablespoon of the cheese and half of the capers."
- "Slice the pressed tofu into large slices. In a bowl, beat the egg with a little salt and pepper. Place the breadcrumbs in a separate bowl and dip the tofu pieces, first in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs so they are coated evenly."
- "Heat up a large frying pan and the oil. Fry the tofu slices until they are crisp and golden brown. Don&#39;t turn up the heat too much, as this will burn the breadcrumbs and flip the tofu until it is cooked on all sides."
- "Toss the salad leaves with the dressing, add pepper to taste and half of the croutons- you can also drizzle some olive oil on the salad here if the dressing isn&#39;t thick enough. Top the salad with the remaining croutons, capers, rest of the cheese and fried tofu slices. Enjoy!"
