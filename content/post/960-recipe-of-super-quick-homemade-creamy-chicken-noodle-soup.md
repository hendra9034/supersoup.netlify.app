recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the butter and olive oil together in a large pot (4 quart or larger) over medium-low heat. Once the butter has melted, add the carrots, onions and celery with a pinch of salt and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then stir in the garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Sprinkle the flour over the veggies and stir to incorporate. Stir and cook an additional 2-3 minutes."
- "Pour in the broth, shredded chicken and the seasonings. Increase the heat to medium-high and let this come to a low boil. Once it begins to boil, stir in the diced potatoes and let them simmer for 2 or so minutes. Then stir in the egg noodles and let simmer for 8-9 minutes more, until the noodles and potatoes are both soft."
- "Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the parsley and while stirring, slowly drizzle in the cream until it is all added and incorporated. That&#39;s it! Serve immediately."
- "Refrigerate any leftovers in a large Tupperware container. To reheat, place desired amount in a small saucepan. Add a bit of extra broth, because the noodles will absorb a lot of the liquid during refrigeration. Bring to a simmer and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes or so."
