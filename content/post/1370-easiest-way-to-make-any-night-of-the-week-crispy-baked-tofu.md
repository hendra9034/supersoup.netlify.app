- "Let the tofu sit for 15-30 minutes allowing the liquid to be squeezed out.  In a medium bowl combine tamari, oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Add tofu to the bowl and gently toss until all of the tofu is lightly coated with the seasoning. Sprinkle corn flour over the top of seasoned tofu and gently toss together."
