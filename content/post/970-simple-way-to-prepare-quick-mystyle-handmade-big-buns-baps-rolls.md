recipeingredient:
- "500 g Strong White Bread Flour"
- "2 1/2 teaspoon easy blend yeast"
- "1 1/2 teaspoon caster sugar"
- "1 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt"
- "1 tablespoon Rapeseed oil"
- "1 large free range egg beaten"
- "100 mls plain Greek yogurt or sour cream"
- " Approx 200mls handhot water"
- " Extra 100mls hand warm water as needed"
- "as needed Extra flour for dusting"
recipeinstructions:
- "In large bowl place flour with salt to one side, yeast &amp; sugar to the other."
- "Make a well in the centre with the handle of a wooden spoon. Add the beaten egg with the oil &amp; yogurt, gradually start mixing to incorporate the flour."
- "Start adding the hand warm water &amp; gradually mix in until it looks shaggy, you might not need all the water or you might need a bit more. Switch to your hands."
- "Tip out on to a clean surface &amp; knead smooth for 15 minutes, have some extra flour handy to dust your hands if the dough is sticky kneading, initially- it should gradually become less sticky."
- "Shape into a ball"
- "Lightly oil the bowl in which you previously mixed the dough."
- "Put the dough into the bowl &amp; rub with a little oil. Cover with oiled clingfilm (I use a shower cap all the time, kept especially for this)"
- "Leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours until doubled in size. I usually put it in my oven with a baking tray on the bottom which I fill with boiling water from the kettle."
- "Lightly oil a large baking tray, I used a 9&#34;x 13&#34;(inches) deep rectangular tray."
- "Tip out the well risen (proved) dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently shape into a log,(dusting your hand with flour if needed) deflating the dough as you go."
- "Divide into 8-12 equal pieces(depends on how big you want your bapsðŸ¤­) &amp; shape each piece into a smooth ball &amp; place in the prepared tray. Sprinkle lightly with flour."
- "Cover loosely with clingfilm. Let it rise 30-45 minutes. I usually put it in the top oven whilst I preheat the bottom oven to 175Â° Fan. (I move the oven shelf to lower half &amp; place an oven tray on the bottom filled with hot water from the kettle. Pre-heat oven after 15 minutes into the second resting phase)"
- "Remove clingfilm, place on oven shelf &amp; bake 25 minutes until nicely browned."
- "Place a tea towel on a wire rack, leave in tin &amp; place tin on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Then remove rolls and place on tea towel, wrap in the tea towel to cool completely (it helps to keep the rolls soft, that&#39;s how we like them)"
