recipeingredient:
- "1 kg pork collarneck"
- "2-3 stalks celery cut into halves"
- "1 onion sliced into half"
- "5 cloves garlic peeled and halved"
- "1 sprig fresh rosemary"
- "2 tbsp marmalade"
- "1/2 tsp Dijon mustard"
- "1/2 tbsp olive oil"
- " Salt and pepper to season"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 220 (fan). Add the red onion, and celery to the baking tray and place the joint of pork on top. Massage the pork all over with 1/2 tbsp olive oil then slice thin slits into the top of the joint and push in the garlic clove halves and a couple of leaves of rosemary into each hole. Don&#39;t over do the fresh rosemary, as it&#39;s a very strong flavour. Season well with black pepper. Roast uncovered for 20 mins on the middle shelf."
- "Turn the oven down to 170 (fan). Pour some water into the tray, around 1 inch deep. Slather the top of the meat in the marmalade and mustard then season with a little salt. Cover over the tray loosely with foil, making a &#39;dome&#39; on top so the foil isn&#39;t touching the glaze as you don&#39;t want it to stick during cooking. Roast low and slow for a further 3 hours until the marmalade is nicely caramalised."
- "Remove the meat from the oven and leave to rest for at least 40 mins before carving. Make use of the juices in the bottom of the tray to make a lovely light gravy that&#39;ll have an incredible flavour. Enjoy! :)"
