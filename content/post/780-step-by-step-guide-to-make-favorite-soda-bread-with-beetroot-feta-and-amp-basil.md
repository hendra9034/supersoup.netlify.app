recipeingredient:
- "400 ml buttermilk"
- "240 g plain flour extra for dusting"
- "240 g wholemeal flour"
- "3 pickled beetroots chopped very finely around 2 wide"
- "100 g crumbled strong Greek feta cheese"
- "1 tsp garlic pure paste"
- "1 tsp bicarb soda"
- "1 tsp table salt"
- "2 generous handfuls fresh basil leaves sliced"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add both flours to a large bowl along with the salt and bicarb, and mix together. Add in the feta cheese, garlic purée and basil leaves, mix through again. Next add the chopped beetroot into the jug of buttermilk and stir well until it takes on the appearance of a strawberry milkshake then pour it in with the other ingredients and using a wooden spoon stir gently until a sticky pink tinted dough is formed."
- "Dust a surface generously with flour and turn out the dough upon it. Fold it over on itself a few times using the bakers scraper, dusting the top with flour as you work and around into a neat ball (do not knead the dough). This dough is very sticky, so I don&#39;t recommend using your hands to shape it. Using the scraper transfer it over to a lined baking tray. Dust flour over the top and using a large sharp knife cut a large cross into the top quite deep down and open out the cuts a little."
- "Leave upon a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper for 30 minutes. Preheat your oven halfway through the dough resting time to 200 (fan). Once the oven is to temperature, bake for around 35 minutes until risen and a beautiful crust is formed. The base should sound hollow when tapped upon, that&#39;s how you&#39;ll know it&#39;s done. Leave to cool on a wire rack before slicing. Do not slice the bread whilst hot otherwise it&#39;ll become sunken and doughy. Enjoy! :)"
