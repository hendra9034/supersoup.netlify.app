recipeingredient:
- "250 g lean beef mince meat"
- "1 egg"
- "2 Tbsp breadcrumbs"
- "1 courgette"
- "1 aubergine"
- "6/8 cherry tomatoes"
- "1 can tomato sauce passata"
- "1 clove garlic"
- "To taste Salt pepper and your favourite herbs"
- "6 Skewers"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, mix the mince meat, pinch of salt and pepper, your favourite herbs (I used garlic powder, onion powder, dry rosemary and sage) and the egg - work it with your hand until smooth. If it&#39;s too wet, gradually add breadcrumbs until it is the right consistency to form meatballs. I got 18 little meatballs out of my mixture."
- "Slice the courgette and the aubergine in 1 cm slices (I peeled my aubergine because my husband is fussy, but there is no need for that!), then halves the little cherry tomatoes. Grate the garlic and reserve for later."
- "In a medium pan, first cook your meatballs (you shouldn&#39;t need any oil as they will release a bit of their own fat, and won&#39;t go dry, but make sure you turn them regularly). When ready, remove them from the pan and keep them warm. In the same pan, cook your slices of aubergine and courgette. Add salt and pepper to taste."
- "Meanwhile, prepare a basic tomato sauce using the garlic, the &#34;passata&#34; sauce, salt and pepper."
- "When the veg are ready, remove them and keep warm, then add the half tomatoes, but only for 1 minute or so, just to soak up the juices and become a little tender. You are then ready to build your skewers: chop each 1cm veg slice in 4 cubes, and proceed to put each 1 element on the skewer, alternatively."
- "Make a bed with your tomato sauce, and serve the skewers on top of it, and don&#39;t forget some fresh crunchy bread to clean the plates afterwards! ;)"
