- "2 tablespoons Caster Sugar"
- " Filling"
- "4 Cooking Apples I used Granny Smith Apples"
- "1/4 cup Caster Sugar"
- "1 teaspoon Ground Cinnamon"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 tablespoon Corn Starch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place a large piece of baking paper on a flat surface. Roll Puff Pastry on the baking paper into a large circle about 35cm in diameter and 4-5mm thick. If you use the store-bought Frozen Puff Pastry, thaw them well, place 1 sheet on the baking paper and the other sheet on top of the first one, then roll out. You might need 3 sheets as you need a large circle."
- "*Note: It is difficult to roll a square into a circle. You can cut the rolled out square into a circle, but do not waste the off-cuts. All off-cuts and scraps can be rolled into a dough and you can use it for something else."
- "Make the filling. Peel Apples if you prefer, cut each Apple into 1/4 wedges, remove the core, and cut into 3-4mm thin slices. Add Sugar, Cinnamon, Salt and Corn Starch, and toss to combine."
- "Pre-heat the oven to 180℃."
- "Spread Plain Flour on the dough, arrange the Apple mixture in the centre about 5cm from the edges, avoid the liquid if any, then fold the edges of the dough over the Apples, creating pleats as required."
- "Transfer the pie on the baking paper onto a baking sheet or tray. You may wish to trim the paper if it is too large. Brush the pleated dough with Egg, sprinkle 1 tablespoon Caster Sugar over the dough, and 1 tablespoon over the Apple."
- "Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes OR until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a serving plate or cutting board, and serve warm with Whipped Cream, Custard OR Ice Cream."
