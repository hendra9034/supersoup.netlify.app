recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, add in bread flour, rye flour, caraway seeds, sugar, salt, baking powder and cornmeal.  Give it a quick mix.  Add in eggs and milk.  *To measure eggs, whisk the eggs and measure with a weighing scale.*  Fold to combine well."
- "The batter should be thick and not runny. It is okay to have a few small lumps.  Transfer the batter into a tall cylinder.  Add about 4 inches of oil into a dutch oven.  Turn the heat up to medium-high, temperature 375 fahrenheit or 190 degree celsius.  While the oil is heating up, insert popsicle sticks into the cheese sticks.  Don&#39;t rush and take your time, as the cheese sticks are pretty fragile."
- "Once the oil is heated, dunk a cheese stick into the batter.  Swirl about 1/2 portion of the cheese corn dog in the oil for about 10 seconds, before dropping it entirely into the oil. It will float almost immediately.  This is to prevent the dog from sticking at the bottom.  Keep flipping for even browning."
- "Once golden brown, remove from heat and drain off excess oil on a wire cooling rack or on a plate lined with kitchen paper.  Repeat the process with the remaining cheese sticks. Do not crowd. Do it one by one or in batches.  Serve immediately."
- "I like to serve mine with some kewpie mayo, nori flakes and sriracha powder.  You can serve it however you desired.  You can also use the batter to make corn dogs with some sausages or hot dogs. Be sure to use the same procedures as stated above."
