recipeingredient:
- " For the brownies"
- "225 g unsalted butter melted"
- "400 g dark brown soft sugar"
- "2 teaspoons vanilla extract"
- "4 large eggs"
- "225 g plain flour"
- "140 g unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon baking powder"
- "100 g dark chocolate chips"
- " For the cashew salted caramel"
- "65 ml water"
- "230 g caster sugar"
- "85 g unsalted butter"
- "130 ml double cream"
- "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt"
- "8 cashew nuts very finely chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "First of all you’ll need to make your salted caramel in advance, well in advance. The recipe above will make more than you need which is great news, this stuff is awesome! You can use it for whatever you like after; add it to porridge, to a pudding, anything!"
- "Put the water into a medium sized saucepan and add the sugar to it bit by bit, stirring it in as you go. This is to make sure the sugar is evenly dispersed and will prevent any crystallisation when you turn the heat on and the caramel is forming. Nobody wants a disaster. Once all the sugar is added brush down any sugar crystal that are clinging to the sides of the saucepan, (use water and a little cooks brush to do this) and then use a medium heat. Don’t stir anything at all, leave it alone!!"
- "Let the sugar go a deep amber colour – don’t be scared to do this, you want it to go as deep an amber colour as possible, without burning it of course. If you’re using a sugar thermometer to check you want it to get to around 360 degree Fahrenheit. Once you get there remove from the heat and add the butter. Put back on the heat until all the butter has melted. BE CAREFUL at this point, the butter tends to make the mixture rise and “spit” a little. It’s very hot, so take care."
- "Remove from the heat again and add vanilla extract and cream. Stir it all together well, but do it quickly. Add again to the heat for about 20 seconds and then remove. Add the chopped nuts and stir them through and then pour the hot caramel sauce into a good sized jar with a screw lid. Leave it on the side to cool down and then put it in the fridge to set for at least 2-3 hours."
- "In a large bowl beat the sugar, butter and vanilla extract together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating each one in until well combined as you go. Sift in the flour, cocoa, salt and baking powder. Gently fold this into the mixture until well combined. You don’t really want to beat this in, you just want to get it absolutely combined so that there are no horrible bits of flour or cocoa left in. Finally, add in the chocolate chips and fold them into the mixture."
- "Spread the mixture into a deep baking tray measuring roughly 30cms x 20cms and bake for 25 minutes in a pre-heated oven, 180°C/350°F/Gas Mark 4."
- "Once baked remove from the oven but leave in the baking tray to cool down. Once cooled cut into whatever sized pieces you like, however I tend to cut into 24 equal pieces. Add a ¾ teaspoon scoop of the salted caramel to the top of each piece (or more if you wish). Voila!"
