recipeinstructions:
- "Small chop all of your vegetables and throw everything [except for anything listed as reserves, garnish or noodles] in a large pot. Boil on high for 20 minutes covered. Or, until your small chopped carrots are softened. They&#39;re your best [doneness] indicator."
- "At 20 minutes, boil your egg noodles as per manufactures directions. Usually 7 minutes - in a separate pot. If not boiled in a separate pot, you&#39;ll dust up your soup with a carb clouded murky broth. Yuck! Do the same with your rice if you choose to employ it. Add 1 tsp salt and a dash of oil to your noodles and cover. Stir occasionally. Drain and add noodles to your soup. Do not rinse your noodles."
- "● Important Steps: Taste test your soup. If you feel your broth is too acidic based upon the high amounts of green/red tomatoes, jalapeños and lemon/lime juice, add a good pinch of baking soda while your soup is at a heavy boil. She&#39;ll foam up quite a bit she&#39;ll settle right down when stirred. So, no worries. Add another pinch of baking soda if you feel it&#39;s needed after a minute or so. Also, add additional 1/2 tbsp Cumin to your pot just before serving. You&#39;ll want that extra kick! Add water as needed for additional broth. Sick kids throats do appreciate their hot broth! I also add additional fresh chilled cilantro [my kids do love their cilantro!] and mix gently just prior to serving."
- "Serve soup piping hot with chilled lime or lemon wedges, [both work quite well, especially on sore throats!] fresh cilantro, avocado slices, tortilla chips [if only to serve their scratchy little throats!] and fresh flour tortillas as an absorbent tummy filler. A dollop of sour cream is also a great addition if, they don&#39;t have upset tummies. Any creams will only curdle in their tiny stomachs. Enjoy!"
