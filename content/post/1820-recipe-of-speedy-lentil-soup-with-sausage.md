- "When the lentils are cooked, add the chard and cook until the leaves are tender, just a few minutes more. Discard the bay leaves."
- "To finish, divide soup among bowls, then add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 garlic cloves to a small skillet and heat over medium until the garlic softens and hisses. Drizzle this over soup bowls, and top with fresh Romano, passing more at the table. Leftovers will keep for several days in the fridge."
