recipeingredient:
- " Vegetable oil or neutral oil enough to cover battered hot dogs"
- " Sausages"
- "4 hot dog or frankfurters cut in half"
- " Pre mixed batter"
- "300 g Japanese hotcake pancake mix"
- "200-250 ml water or milk use more or less"
- " Making own batter"
- "300 g cake flour or low gluten or protein flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "200-250 ml water or milk use more or less"
- "1 egg"
- " Garnish"
- " Mustard"
- " Ketchup"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a pot or tempura pot add the vegetable oil. Heat the oil between 150-160 degrees. Tip: to check if the oil is ready and hot enough, dip a chopstick into the oil. If it bubbles it is ready to use."
- "Cut the hot dogs in half (optional, depending on size). Poke skewers through the middle of the hot dogs and transfer onto a baking tray."
- "Pour pancake flour into a large mixing bowl. Add water a tiny bit at a time. Keep adding until the batter is to desired consistency. Tip: the batter consistency should be thick. If it is too thin the batter will not stick to the hot dog."
- "Transfer the batter into a large tall cup. This helps to ensure that the hot dog is evenly coated. You may need to dip or turn the hot dogs in the batter to get a nice even coating. Once the hot dog is evenly coated drip off any excess batter and quickly and gently transfer into the oil."
- "As the corn dogs cook they will surface to the top and flat. Use tongs or chopsticks to constantly rotate and hold the hot dogs in place to ensure they fry and brown evenly. Once corn dogs have fried evenly to golden brown all around, transfer to a pre lined baking tray with paper towel to soak off the excess oil."
- "Transfer corn dogs onto a serving plate and serve with mustard or ketchup and eat immediately white pipping hot."
