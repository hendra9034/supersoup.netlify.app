recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the rice in either a rice cooker or in a pot. Keep warm until needed."
- "In a bowl transfer the mince meat and season with white pepper, salt and Shaoshing rice wine. Set aside."
- "Finely chop the garlic, ginger and spring onions and set aside. In a wok on medium heat, heat up the oil, add the Sichuan peppercorns and cook until fragment. Then add the ginger and the chopped stalks of the spring onions and stir occasionally to prevent burning. Cook for 1-2 minutes."
- "Add the mince meat and break it into small grains (to avoid getting clumps) using a wooden spatula. When the meat is almost cooked add the garlic and stir occasionally to avoid the garlic getting burnt."
- "When the meat is cooked add both types of doubanjiang stirring to distribute the paste evenly, then add the rest of the sauces. Let it cook for a few minutes so the meat can soak in the flavours of the sauces. Then add the hot water (pre boiled kettle water) and let it simmer.

Taste the sauce and amend if needed (add more spicy chilli sauce for hotter, white pepper or non spicy doubangjiang etc)."

- "Now add cornstarch mixture to wok. Stir everything gently, place a lid on the wok. Leave to simmer and turn the heat to very low heat for 5 - 10 minutes until the sauce thickens a little. Tip: you want the sauce to still be runny for the gratin so it can soak into the rice. If not runny add a little bit of water to loosen. Once the sauce is to desired thickness turn the heat off."
