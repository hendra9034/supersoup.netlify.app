Topped with crispy bacon, sharp cheese and scallions, this is a dinner meal the whole family will love. Bacon - be sure to get your bacon nice and crispy, as it makes for a great crunch in contrast to the rest of the soup. Totally loaded potato soup is a good name for it since we pack it with extras like lots of bacon, diced onions and chives. Potatoes - I like Yukon, they soften well but it is really up to you in the end.

Totally loaded potato soup is a good name for it since we pack it with extras like lots of bacon, diced onions and chives. Potatoes - I like Yukon, they soften well but it is really up to you in the end. Also I like to leave the skins on for added texture and it is more nutritious. You may have to cut the ingredients in half for a mini IP, or adjust the cooking times if you have a different brand pressure cooker. This creamy Instant Pot® potato soup has a salty, smoky taste from smoked bacon, and can be customized with assorted toppings.
