- "5 garlic cloves"
- "2 tbsp sweet paprika"
- "4 Bay leaves I used fresh leaves"
- "Handful fresh parsley chopped"
- "3 big onions"
- "400 ml white wine"
- "1 drizzle of olive oil"

- "6-8 whole cloves"
- " Cracked black pepper to taste"
- "1 kg baby new potatoes"
- "1.9 kg approximately of lamb shoulder or leg"
recipeinstructions:
- "First start by marinating the lamb. I like to make a couple of deep cuts on the cut of meat with a really sharp knife as this will help absorb the flavour of the marinade and cook evenly."
- "For the marinade, slice one of the onions thinly and three of the garlic cloves. Add the onions and garlic to the lamb. Next add 1 tablespoon of paprika, 2 Bay leaves cut into pieces, cloves, parsley, mint and season with salt and pepper. Top with the wine. Cover with clingfilm and leave in fridge from overnight."
- "The next day, transfer the lamb to an ovenproof tray along with all the marinade contents and liquid. Drizzle with olive oil. Cover the tray with foil. Place in a preheated oven of 150c for 2 hours."
- "After 2 hours remove the foil and baste with its own juices. Increase heat to about 180c. Continue to cook for about 90 minutes or so and continue to baste regularly. I used a meat thermometer to check that it was cooked through."
- "In the meantime make the potatoes. Peel the baby new potatoes. Add them to an ovenproof tray. Cut the 2 remaining onions into 8 wedges and slice the remaining garlic. Add the garlic and onions to the potatoes. Add the remainder of the paprika, bay leaves, cut into pieces and season with salt and pepper. Finally drizzle with olive oil."
- "Transfer to the oven and bake for 90 minutes or so until cooked through. Shake occasionally to avoid sticking or burning."
- "Once the lamb is nice and brown on top cut the lamb into pieces and place back into its juices. Once the potatoes are cooked through add them to the lamb tray. Place back in the oven for a further 10 minutes."
- "To serve sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley. Serve along side a salad and crusty bread."
