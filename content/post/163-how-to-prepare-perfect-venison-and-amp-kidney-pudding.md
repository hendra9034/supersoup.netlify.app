recipeinstructions:
- "First, making the filling. Pat the venison fry with kitchen paper and lightly coat in the plain flour. Melt the butter and 1 tbsp of the oil in a large, heavy based saucepan. When the butter is foaming, add the meat and just brown all over in the oil. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate."
- "Add a little more oil to the pan you just used for the meat and add the onions and garlic and cook until softened, then pour in the red wine to de glaze the pan. Add the venison back into the pan along with the stock and bring to the boil, simmer and cover for about 20 minutes."
- "Add more stock if the sauce looks too thick. Add the rosemary, cinnamon stick, cranberry jelly and allspice. Put this into a slow cooker or slow oven at 140 degrees C for 2 hours."
- "Add the diced kidney and carrot and put back into the slow cooker or oven for a further 1.5 hours."
- "Add the mushrooms and put back for a final 30 minutes. Check for tenderness and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside to cool completely"
- "When you are ready to cook the pudding, first, liberally butter a 1.2 litre pudding basin."
- "Next, make the pastry. Mix all the pastry ingredients together and season with salt and pepper. Gradually stir in water until you have a soft? Slightly sticky dough. You’ll need around 225ml water."
- "Divide off roughly a quarter of the dough (for the pastry lid). Dust your work surface with flour and roll out the bigger piece of pastry to to around a 12in diameter circle. Use this to line the pudding basin, leaving the excess pastry hanging over the edges. Roll out the smaller piece of dough to a size large enough to form a lid for the basin."
- "Spoon the cooled venison filling into the pastry-lined basin. Dampen the edges with water and top with the pastry lid. Press the edges together to seal using your thumb and forefingers and trim away the excess pastry neatly."
- "If your basin doesn’t come with a lid, put a piece of foil big enough to fit over the top of the basin and come halfway down the sides, making a pleat down the middle to allow for expansion. Tie it in place with some string, making a string handle so you can lift it when topping up with water. Pour about 3-4cm hot water into your pressure cooker and lower the pudding into It. Close the lid and cook for 45 minutes."
- "Remove the pudding from the pressure cooker and leave to rest for 5 minutes. Then, using a small sharp knife, release the side of the pudding from the basin. Put a large plate over the pudding and invert it, so the pudding comes out onto the plate and serve straight away!"
