- "1 tsp lemon thyme leaves picked and finely chopped"
- "1 sage leaf chopped"
- "1/4 tsp chilli flakes"
- "1/2 tbsp tomato puree"
- "3 small ripe tomatoes peeled seeded chopped"

- "1 garlic clove crushed"
- "50 g flat leaf parsley chopped"
- "1 squeeze lemon juice"
- " sea salt and black pepper"
- " Polenta"
- "300 ml vegetable stock"
- "200 ml almond milk"
- "80 g polenta instant or traditional"
- "30 g coconut oil"
- "20 g nutritional yeast optional"
- " Oregano oil"
- "1 bunch fresh oregano"
- "200 ml oil of choice extra virgin rapeseed nut oil"
- "200 g tenderstem broccoli"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start with the oregano oil to allow the flavours more chance to infuse. Pour the oil into a small saucepan. Put your oregano leaves into the oil and on a very low heat and gently heat the oil until you see a few small bubbles rise to the surface. Turn the heat off immediately and let the oil sit until ready to serve."
- "Next focus on the ragu. To prepare the tomatoes, score the tops of them with a cross and dunk into a bowl of hot water. Leave for 30 seconds, remove and dunk into a bowl of cold water, leaving for a minute. Using the edge of the crosses, peel the skin away. Quarter the tomatoes and scoop out the seeds."
- "Clean the mushrooms using a pastry brush, keeping the Portobello mushrooms separate."
- "In a wide frying pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over a medium-high heat. Saute the onion until brown and softened. Remove from the pan and set aside."
- "In the same pan, heat another tbsp olive oil and cook the Portobello mushrooms until golden in colour. Lower the heat, add the sage, thyme, chilli flakes, tomato puree, tomatoes, rehydrated wild mushrooms (keeping the liquid), salt and pepper, and give everything a stir, cooking for a couple of minutes to allow the flavours to infuse."
- "Add the flour by sprinkling evenly across the pan, stirring for a few minutes to evenly incorporate and cook the flour. Add the onions back in."
- "Pour in half the dried mushroom liquid and keep stirring to encourage the flour to thicken the liquid evenly. Once thickened, gradually add the remaining mushroom liquid in and cook for two minutes until the sauce has a gravy-like consistency. Add water to thin the sauce if desired."
- "Taste and adjust the seasoning, it may need a squeeze of lemon juice. The ragu can now be cooled for re-heating later or freezing. However, hold it in the pan and make the polenta."
- "Bring the stock and cashew milk to the boil in a saucepan. Slowly stir in the polenta, then reduce the heat to the minimum and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. The polenta is ready when it leaves the sides of the pan but is still runny. If you are using instant polenta this shouldn&#39;t take more than five minutes; with traditional polenta it could take up to 50 minutes (if it seems to dry out,add some more stock or water but just enough to keep it at a thick porridge consistency)."
- "Once cooked, add the coconut oil and nutritional yeast (if you are using it) and generously season (polenta takes a lot of salt and pepper). Cover with a lid and sit to one side, ready to heat up before serving."
- "Just before serving, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan on moderate heat and add the wild mushrooms. Season and saute for two minutes until they begin to colour. Add the garlic and parsley, cook for one minute, stirring. Add the mushrooms to the sauce."
- "Whilst these mushrooms are cooking, trim any thin stalk ends off the tenderstem broccoli. Bring water in a small saucepan to boil, place a steamer on top and steam the tenderstem for five minutes until tender but still retaining a bite."
- "Time to serve. If the polenta has cooled slightly, re-heat and in a warm serving bowl/plate spread a smooth generous layer over the bottom of the plate. Lay across the tenderstem coating with the mushroom ragu and drizzle over the oregano oil."

##### Steps to make Wild Mushroom Ragu with Polenta and Oregano Oil:

1. Start with the oregano oil to allow the flavours more chance to infuse. Pour the oil into a small saucepan. Put your oregano leaves into the oil and on a very low heat and gently heat the oil until you see a few small bubbles rise to the surface. Turn the heat off immediately and let the oil sit until ready to serve.
1. Next focus on the ragu. To prepare the tomatoes, score the tops of them with a cross and dunk into a bowl of hot water. Leave for 30 seconds, remove and dunk into a bowl of cold water, leaving for a minute. Using the edge of the crosses, peel the skin away. Quarter the tomatoes and scoop out the seeds.
1. Clean the mushrooms using a pastry brush, keeping the Portobello mushrooms separate.
1. In a wide frying pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over a medium-high heat. Saute the onion until brown and softened. Remove from the pan and set aside.
1. In the same pan, heat another tbsp olive oil and cook the Portobello mushrooms until golden in colour. Lower the heat, add the sage, thyme, chilli flakes, tomato puree, tomatoes, rehydrated wild mushrooms (keeping the liquid), salt and pepper, and give everything a stir, cooking for a couple of minutes to allow the flavours to infuse.

The polenta is ready when it leaves the sides of the pan but is still runny. If you are using instant polenta this shouldn&#39;t take more than five minutes; with traditional polenta it could take up to 50 minutes (if it seems to dry out,add some more stock or water but just enough to keep it at a thick porridge consistency).
