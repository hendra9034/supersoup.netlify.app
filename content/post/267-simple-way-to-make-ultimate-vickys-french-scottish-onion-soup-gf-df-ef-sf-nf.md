recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the butter &amp; oil together over a medium low heat in a large stock pot. Add the onions and turn the heat to low. Give them a stir to coat in the oil then put the lid on and find something else to do for 15 minutes, don&#39;t disturb the onions"
- "After the 15 minutes are up, uncover the pot, add the sugar &amp; salt and cook the onions for at least 45 minutes, stirring frequently until they are lovely and caramelized. Don&#39;t skimp on the cooking time here. This is what builds the intense flavour base, just like a gumbo roux"
