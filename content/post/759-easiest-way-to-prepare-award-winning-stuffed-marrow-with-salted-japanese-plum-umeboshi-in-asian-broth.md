Salty plum is one way to refer to umeboshi, a type of preserved Japanese plum. I use the term &#34;plum&#34; rather loosely here, as the ume fruit in Japan is akin to a cross between plum and apricot.

The umes spend up to a year entombed in salt and are often pickled in vinegar and shiso leaves. Umeboshi, Japanese salted plums, are a delicacy often enjoyed with rice. Here&#39;s a traditional method for making them. This recipe is reprinted with permission from Preserving the Japanese Way: Traditions of Salting, Fermenting, and Pickling for the Modern Kitchen by Nancy Singleton Hachisu, Â©. Green sour plums, or ume, are layered with salt and red shiso leaves (for color and flavor) and cured until the plums release all of their liquid, then I was able to find umeboshi locally at Whole Foods and Asian markets with a good assortment of Japanese products; that said, they are not perishable.
