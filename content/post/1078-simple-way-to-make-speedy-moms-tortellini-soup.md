recipeinstructions:
- "Begin by prepping your veggies. Kath always kept the veggies in this soup fairly chunky, it makes it easier to prep and quicker to make. Peel the carrots and roughly chop them into ¼ in thick rounds. Dice the onions and celery, and slice the garlic into rounds or mince/press if preferred."
- "Slice bacon into 1 in slices and fry over medium height in a soup pot. Allow to cook but not get too crispy. Transfer from pan to a paper towel lined plate."
- "Saute onions and garlic in the remaining bacon grease. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste."
- "When onions and garlic have cooked down add the carrots and celery. Allow the veggies to saute and soften."
- "Add 8 cups of broth to pot and bring to a simmer"
- "When the pot has reached a simmer add the bag of tortellini and allow to cook for five minutes. Reduce the heat."
- "Add the bag of frozen spinach and cooked bacon to the pot and stir. Remove from heat and serve. Best served sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and a piece of crusty bread."
- "Why limit yourself to just these veggies? Have some kale that needs to be used up? Chop it up and substitute for spinach. Have a potato or some corn that needs to get used up? Throw it in! The more veggies the better."
- "Need a bacon-break? 1. Who are you?! 2. Crisp some prosciutto or pancetta in olive oil before throwing the veggies into the pot and add a little olive oil before the veggies so they cook more evenly..."
- "Any stuffed pasta can be used. Try saccottini or ravioli, even better if you’ve made them yourself as Kath likes to remind me. I like prosciutto and cheese tortellini but mushroom ravioli or spinach and ricotta tortellini would also be delicious."
