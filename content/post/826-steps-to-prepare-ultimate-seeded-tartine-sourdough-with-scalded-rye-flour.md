- "60g virgin olive oil"

- "Scald your rye flour and seeds by boiling 400g water and allowing to cool for 5 minutes. Then pour over the rye flour and seeds. Cover with cling film (when cooled) and leave overnight. I generally start my sourdough first thing in the morning. Start by pouring the olive oil and filtered water in your mixing bowl, add your levain and mix well. Then add the scalded flour and mix in well. Add the very strong white flour and mix roughly."
- "Cover and leave in a proofer @ 27°C or in a warm room for 30 minutes. Next add the salt and mix in. Leave in the proofer for 40 minutes then stretch and fold 4 times. Repeat this every 40 minutes. Total time in the proofer - 4 hours. Split your dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each loaf and place in bannetons which have been coated in rice flour and cover. Back in the proofer for 1.5 to 2 hours. Then place in a fridge @ 2°C for the afternoon and overnight."
- "Next morning take 1 banneton from the fridge and allow your dough to reach room temperature. Pre-heat your oven to 220°C, slash your dough and place in your cloche/Dutch oven for 22 minutes with the lid on and 21 minutes with the lid off. If you have a cast iron Dutch oven, place 5 or 6 ice cubes around the dough."
- "If you are a relative newcomer to the art of sourdough baking, have a look on YouTube for stretching and folding techniques and shaping dough. Vary your seed combinations and herbs to your liking. I vary the flour I use - Spelt, Khorasan or rye (80g to 100g) but always at least 700g very strong white flour per kilo sourdough batch. Vary the water content to get a more open crumb texture but the dough becomes a lot more difficult to handle the higher the hydration."
- "Why scald flour? It will give you a loaf of bread that is more moist and will last longer! Also if you’re keen to make bread with a flour that has lower levels of gluten than wheat flour, for example rye, barley or buckwheat, scalding is the method to use. A scalded flour recipe will need a larger water content so make sure you adjust any recipes using this method.  In most of my recipes I use 70% hydration. With this one the hydration is 75% and could easily go to 80%."
