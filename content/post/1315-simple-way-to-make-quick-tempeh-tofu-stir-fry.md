recipeinstructions:
- "Wrap tofu with a kitchen towel.  Put some weight on it and set it aside for 30 mins.  Most of the moisture should release from the tofu.  Slice the tofu however you prefer. I sliced the tofu into 16 pieces.  If you have a tofu presser, use it."
- "In a shallow bowl, mix corn starch and paprika together.  Dredge the tofu lightly with the paprika mixture.  In a skillet over medium heat, add about 1 inch of oil.  *To check the temperature of the oil, simply insert a wooden chopstick. If bubbles start to form around the chopstick, the oil is ready.*  Carefully, add in the tofu."
- "Fry until golden brown on both sides.  Remove from heat and set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain off excess oil.  In the same oil, add in 200g of sliced tempeh.  *I sliced the tempeh rather thinly. You can slice them however you prefer.*  Fry until golden brown on both sides.  Remove from heat and set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain off excess oil."
- "Drain the skillet, leaving just enuff oil for stir frying.  Add in the onion.  Season with salt and sugar.  Saute until lightly caramelized.  Add in the remaining 200g of tempeh and garlic."
- "Stir fry until aromatic or until the tempeh starts to cook.  In a small bowl, mix Sambal Hijau and kecap manis together.  Add this sambal mixture into the skillet.  Saute until well combined.  Dissolve miso paste in 1/2 cup of hot water."
- "Add this miso mixture into the skillet and deglaze.  Bring it up to slow simmer.  Add in the fried tofu, tempeh and green beans.  Stir fry until well combined."
- "Continue stir fry until the green beans have slightly softened.  Taste and adjust for seasoning with salt and mushroom powder.  Add in liquid smoke and white soy sauce.  Give it a final stir fry.  Remove from heat and transfer onto serving plates.  Serve this over some rice or noodles immediately."
