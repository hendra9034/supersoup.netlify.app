recipeingredient:
- " Radish salad"
- "3 tbsp finely julienned scallion about 1 inch long"
- "3 tbsp finely julienned carrot about 1 inch long"
- "3 tbsp finely julienned radish about 1 inch long"
- "1 tbsp chopped chives"
- " Lemon oil"
- " Orange glaze"
- "2 cups fresh orange juice"
- "2 tbsp cold unsalted butter cut into 4 pieces"
- "1/4 tsp soy sauce"
- " Cannelloni Beans"
- "1/4 cup Cannelloni beans blanched for about 8 minutes or until tender chilled in ice water and drained"
- "1 tbsp tomato diamonds"
- "1 tsp brunoise"
- "3 tbsp unsalted butter"
- " Brunoise"
- "1 part carrots sliced lengthwise on a mandolin into 16 inch thick strips"
- "1 part turnips sliced lengthwise on a mandolin into 16 inch thick strips"
- "1/2 part leek greens dark green part"
- " Blue eye cod"
- "3 (5 inches) blue eye cod filet skin on"
- " Kosher salt and ground white pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the salad:  About 1 hour before serving, place the julienned scallion, carrot, and radish in a bowl of ice water. The scallions will curl and the chilling will enable the vegetables to hold a tighter nest."
- "For the orange glaze:  Place the orange juice in a small saucepan and reduce over medium heat to a thick glaze (about 1/2 cup). Set aside."
- "For Tomato diamonds:  Peel and quarter a tomato. Place skin side down, cut away the interior and trim the ribs to create an even sheet. Turn pieces over and cut into 1/4 inch strips. Cut strips on the diagonal into diamond shapes."
- "For Brunoise:  Cut all the vegetables into 1/16 inch julienne strips and then cut across to make 1/ 16 inch dice."
- "Blanch each vegetable separately in lightly salted boiling water to set the colour and soften the vegetables."
- "When the vegetable are cooked, lift out the strainer and plunge it into ice water for a few seconds to chill the vegetables and set the colour. Then lift out the strainer and place the vegetable on paper towels to drain."
- "When all the vegetables are blanched and drained, mix them together in a covered container and refrigerate for up to day."
- "For longer storage, spread the drained brunoise on a tray and place the tray in the freezer until frozen. Store the frozen brunoise in a well sealed plastic bag in the freezer. You can use the brunoise directly from the freezer in the recipes where it is warmed before serving."
- "Brunoise, what we call tiny dice of staple vegetables, is used often as a garnish."
- "For the Cannelloni:  Combine cannelloni, tomato diamonds, brunoise, and unsalted butter in a pan and heat over low heat. Keep warm."
- "To complete:  Heat the orange glaze to a simmer and whisk in the butter piece by piece. Add the soy sauce and keep the glaze warm."
- "Drain the iced vegetables and toss them with chives and a small amount of lemon oil."
- "For the blue eye cod:  Heat about 1/8 inch oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the fish with salt and white pepper. Add the fish fillets skin side down and cook for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, occasionally pressing down on the pieces with a spatula to help brown the skin."
- "Flip the fillets and “kiss” (just briefly cook) the other side, then remove the fish from the pan."
- "To finish:  Place 1 to 2 tbsp of the orange glaze in the center of each plate. Place about 1 to 2 tbsp of Cannelloni mixture in the center of the glaze, allowing it to spread into the glaze."
- "Place the fish skin side up over the beans. Gently place a small pile of the crips salad on one end of each fish fillet and serve."
