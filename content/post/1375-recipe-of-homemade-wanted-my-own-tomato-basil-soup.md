recipeinstructions:

And in that case, dice your onions.and celery, add to the pan, this is where you add your dry herbs And spices. We are going to season our onions. Amd add soya sauce just a sprinkle, it adds a nice salt flavour to the onions. Its incredible the flavour you can get from them."
- "Your seasoning salt, garlic oregano, And dry basil.. I always keep a cup of water beside my stove. I add some to my pan, top my pan w a lid, steam slightly. Onions are different during break down. They don&#39;t break down straight up as easily."
- "Open your tomatoes, And find a nice big pot, lets go. Add your tomatoes to the pot. (If you have fresh tomatoes to use this is where I&#39;the suggest dicing them, And add them to your frying pan, getting a nice cook on them first. Add salt to them not a lot just flavour."

- "Chop up your fresh Basil leaves. **I am not particular. Also I chop up the stems which you can eat or remove after leave them."
- "So you&#39;ll be able to remove them. Mix well,gently. Turn you tomatoes up slowly, I add the milk in whilst the tomatoes are still cold. Same w the cream, (if you choose to use cream) its still very yummy w just milk.. add your basil.. add some more dry basil if you choose to... i season to preference, so its not always exactly a tsp."
- "Tidbit** I have also shredded carrots for this soup. Mmm but I really like when I add peppers... I will have to upload my &#34;Roasted Pepper and Tomato soup&#34;"
- "Turn up let boil, try to gently simmer your diced tomatoes. Adding some salt And pepper. I add a small pinch of cayenne during this sonit can simmer into the soup itself. I start small, to each their own on **heat ðŸ˜œ"
- "I usually turn the stove down by this point, its been approx 15 to 20mins. And simmer slowly for another 15 -30 this all depends how you feel about temperature on your stove. How you like your flavours blend, And come together. Then I take a masher and crush all the tomatoes, and so they are still pieces but not entirely."
- "So I add parmesan or mozzarella cheese on top w a serving as well, a dollop of either ricotta or sour cream in the centre. Adds a different definition of flavours. Mm"
- "Hopefully I havent missed anything and its easy to understand.. Enjoy. Great for a cold day its a nice thick creamy tomato"
