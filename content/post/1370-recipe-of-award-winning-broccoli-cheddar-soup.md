- "In a large soup pot with weighted bottom (if possible so soup doesn&#39;t stick) add the other 4 tablespoons of butter, flour, and cook on medium heat for approx. 5 minutes while whisking constantly with wire whip until mixture is thickened. This is an important step. If this mixture doesn&#39;t thinking properly, soup will not thicken later in the process."

- "Go ahead and stir in most, but not all of the cheese saving some for garnish. Give cheese a chance to melt. (About 1 minute DO NOT use pre-grated cheese! The flavor is just not there and that&#39;s crucial to this soup."
- "At this point, go ahead and serve soup into individual bowls and add a little cheese to the top of each bowl. If you have kids, add a few goldfish crackers to peak their interest."
- "Leftover soup can be kept in air tight containers for 1 week only! Warm in microwave. Enjoy!"
