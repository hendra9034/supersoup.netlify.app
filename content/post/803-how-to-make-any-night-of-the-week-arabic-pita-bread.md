recipeinstructions:
- "Add the sugar and yeast to a bowl and mix with 125ml of water then leave for about 5-10 minutes until you have bubbles formed on the surface"
- "Pour the yeast over 300g of plain flour with a pinch of salt and mix together to form a smooth dough. Cover and leave on the side for 30 minutes."
- "Roll out the dough and split it into around 10 parts, be sure to add some flour to the surface to stop it from sticking - each ball should be around 80g"
- "Cover the dough balls again for 10 minutes"
- "Using the rolling pin, roll the dough into a circular shape with a thickness of ~1cm"
- "Add the dough now on a preheated pan or under the grill in a preheated oven. Don‚Äôt touch or flip the bread until it completely puffs (if it‚Äôs in a pan wait until the bottom is brown and if you‚Äôre doing it in the oven then obviously flip the bread when the top is brown)"
- "Keep the bread covered with a clean towel while you work on the rest of the dough. This will keep the bread soft and nice. As you can see not all the bread got puffy and this has to do with the pan temperature but it still tasted so good. Also the bread won‚Äôt stay puffy once out of the oven but you‚Äôll be able to open it as a pocket and stuff it with yummy things!"
