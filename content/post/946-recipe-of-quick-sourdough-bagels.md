recipeingredient:
- "150 g sourdough starter"
- "250 g warm water"
- "20 g sugar"
- "500 g organic bread flour"
- "8 g salt"
- "20 g agave syrup"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add starter, water and sugar to a large bowl and whisk together."
- "Add the flour and salt and combine (using hands and/or dough scraper). This doesn&#39;t need to be perfect but you&#39;re aiming for all the flour to be incorporated in to the dough. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 minutes."
- "After the dough has rested, quickly work it into a smooth-ish ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with the damp tea towel and leave to rest until the dough doubles in size, 8-10 hours (or overnight)."
- "Line baking tray (I needed 2) with parchment paper and oil lightly. Remove dough onto non floured surface and separate in to 8 balls. Place the balls on the baking tray and cover again with the tea towel to rest for 20 mins."
- "Once rested, pick up each ball and form a hole in the middle using your thumbs while gradually rolling the dough to form a bagel shape. Place back on the baking tray for another 20 mins. Whisk together the agave and water in a pan and bring to the boil. Preheat oven to 220Â°C."
- "Once rested and the water is boiling, boil each bagel in the pan (30 seconds each side) and return to the baking tray using a slotted spoon."
- "Bake the boiled bagels in the oven for 20 mins. I turned mine over with ~4 minutes to go to brown the bottoms. Enjoy!"
