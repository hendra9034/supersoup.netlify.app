recipeinstructions:
- "In a stock pot or large sauce pan, saute carrots, onions, and celery in the olive oil until tender. I know my mirepoix proportions aren&#39;t traditional - you should use what works best for you."
- "Add in the stock, potatoes, tomato paste, and thyme. Stir to make sure the tomato paste is thoroughly combined."

- "My gf likes things a little sweet, so I added about a 1/2 tsp or so of sugar at this point. Personally, I&#39;d leave it out but it does round the taste a bit."
- "Let cool and then refrigerate for at least two hours to let the tastes combine. Reheat, garnish with fresh dill, and serve."
