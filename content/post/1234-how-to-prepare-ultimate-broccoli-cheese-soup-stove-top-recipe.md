recipeingredient:
- "1 tbsp. olive oil"
- "1 large carrot peeled and finely diced"
- "1/2 yellow onion diced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter"
- "1/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "2 1/2 cups unsalted chicken or vegetable broth"
- "2 1/2 cups milk at room temperature"
- "2 heaping cups fresh chopped broccoli florets"
- "1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese shredded  extra for topping"
- "1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese"
- "1/2 tsp. each salt pepper"
- "1/4 tsp. dried thyme"
- "1/8 tsp. each dried oregano ground nutmeg"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add in the carrots and onions and cook, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent...about 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook a minute or so more, until fragrant. Then add in the butter and let it melt down."
- "Gradually whisk in the flour in small batches. Whisk constantly until all the flour is added and incorporated. Mixture will be very thick. Allow the mix to cook for 1 minute, continuing to whisk."
- "Whisk in the broth in small amounts, whisking constantly, until fully incorporated. Once all the broth is added, whisk in the milk and increase heat to med-high. Let this mixture come to a low boil."
- "Once it reaches a boil, stir in the broccoli and lower the heat to med-low. Allow to simmer until the broccoli is tender...about 7-9 minutes. (If using larger sized florets, it may take longer). Then stir in the cream cheese and let that melt down into the soup."
- "Stir in the seasonings and taste to see if you think it needs anything else. Then, if you&#39;d like a less chunky soup, use an immersion blender to puree to the desired consistency. You could also use a blender or food processor in small batches, just be careful not to burn yourself."
- "Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in both of the shredded cheeses until it is all melted and incorporated in. That&#39;s it, you&#39;re ready to serve!"
