recipeingredient:
- "60 g salted butter"
- "2-4 tsp dried chilli flakes"
- "3 finely chopped white onions"
- "9 garlic cloves finely minced it is a lot but its needed"
- "4 tins chopped tomatoes"
- " Salt"
- " Ground black pepper"
- " Soft brown sugar"
- "Bunch fresh basil"
recipeinstructions:
- "First of all separate the leaves from the stalks of the basil. Finely chop the stalks, don&#39;t throw them away as they give good flavour. And roughly chop the leaves. Keep them separated as they&#39;ll go in at different points of the sauce. Set aside for now."
- "Put the butter into a large pot. Turn the hob onto a medium heat and melt the butter completely, but be very careful not to burn it. When the butter goes brown it goes bitter."
- "Add the 2-4 tsp chilli flakes to the butter. I put 2-4 because it&#39;s down to personal preference on how hot you want the sauce. And lightly fry the chilli flakes in the butter for a minute, again being careful not to burn it."
- "Then add the onions and garlic to the pot and mix well into the butter and chilli flakes. Turn up the heat slightly and fry the onions for a few minutes or until they start to soften."
- "Add the chopped tomatoes and the stalks of the basil, not the leaves yet, and mix well. Then add 1/2 tsp salt (remember the butter is salted so don&#39;t add too much) and 2 tsp black pepper, mix well again. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 30 minutes."
- "Just before serving add 1 tsp sugar, this brings out the flavour in the tomatoes. And add the basil leaves. Mix well and serve with a pasta of your choice."
