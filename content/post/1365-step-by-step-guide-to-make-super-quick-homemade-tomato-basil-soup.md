- "Next, stir in tomatoes and vegetable broth, season with salt, pepper, and 1 TBSP of basil. Bring the pot to boil, then cover, and reduce heat to low. Allow the soup to simmer for at LEAST 20 mins, but the longer the better, you can leave it simmering for a couple hours for more flavor.

We also added in 1/4 cup fresh basil (this is optional). Let the soup simmer for 15-30 mins, the longer, the thicker it will be. Then you’re done! ENJOY!"
