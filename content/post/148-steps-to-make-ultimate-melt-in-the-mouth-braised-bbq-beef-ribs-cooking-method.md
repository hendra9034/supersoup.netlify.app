- "1 kg beef short ribs"
- " BBQ dry rub see my recipe"
- " BBQ sauce see my recipe"
recipeinstructions:
- "Firstly you need to marinade your beef short ribs in the BBQ dry rub, and make up the BBQ sauce in a saucepan, then once you&#39;re ready to cook them, preheat your oven to 160 (fan)."
- "Lay the marinated short ribs meat side down in a sided baking tray then pour your BBQ sauce all over. The sauce will slide off the bone sections a bit, but don&#39;t worry about that. Cover tightly with foil then cook for 2.5-3 hours. Low and slow is key here. If your beef ribs are particularly large and meaty please note you may need to cook them a little longer than this, but this was more than enough for the ones I had."
- "Remove the foil and baste the ribs well all over with the reduced down BBQ sauce, getting into all the crevices. You may notice that quite a bit of oil has seperated here in the tray, don&#39;t worry this will reduce down on the next step. Cook for a further 20-30 minutes without the foil. The ribs should now be a deep brown and a little caramalised at the edges."
- "Remove the ribs carefully when removing from the baking tray as they&#39;ll easily fall apart. Mix up the remaining BBQ sauce in the tray and give them a generous final basting. The ribs will be melt in the mouth tender and you&#39;ll be able to pull the bones out clean. Enjoy! :)"
