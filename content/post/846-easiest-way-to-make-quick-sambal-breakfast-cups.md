recipeinstructions:
- "Check out my previous post for the sambal recipe.           (see recipe)"
- "Preheat oven to 190 degrees celsius or 375 fahrenheit.  Brush muffin tin with sesame oil.  Trim the crusts from the bread.  Roll the bread using a rolling pin and slice it into halves.  Push 2 slices of bread onto the sides of each muffin mold, making sure the bread sits fully.  Plug the center hole with a smaller slice of bread, which is why we need 8 slices of bread."
- "In a small bowl, mix sambal and mayo until well combined.  Spread the sambal mixture into the bread cups.  *If you need more sambal-mayo mixture, use the same ratio.*  In a skillet over medium heat, add in oil.  Once the oil is heated up, add in the turkey bacon slices.  Once the edges start to crisp, flip and cook for another 30 secs.  *We only wanna sear the bacon until the edges are crisp brown. They will finish cooking in the oven.*"
- "Remove from heat and transfer onto a plate.  Brush the bacon with gula melaka syrup, on both sides.  Place the bacon slices into the bread slices, overhanging, at the center, just where the bread ends meet.  Crack an egg into a cup or bowl.  Scoop out the yolk with a spoon and drop it gently into the cups, on top of the bacon."
- "Fill the cups with egg white.  Repeat the process for the remaining eggs.  *I find that doing it this way will reduce the mess, as the bread cups may be overflowing with egg whites and cause a huge mess.*  Wack into the oven and bake for 10 to 15 mins, or until the egg whites are set but still jiggly.  Remove from oven, season with salt, pepper and garnish with parsley.  Carefully unmold and transfer onto serving plates.  Serve immediately."
