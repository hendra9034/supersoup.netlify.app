recipeinstructions:
- "(optional) For extra beefy flavour, make beef stock with the bones by boiling them in water with your largest stock pot. After about 5 minutes there will be a lot of scum on top, so use a strainer to skim off the scum every couple of minutes until the stock produces no more foam. It should look a bit green and oily when finished (see pic). Reduce heat to keep it simmering for 1-3 hrs to extract maximum flavour. Alternatively, you can skip this step just use water"
- "While stock is simmering, blanch your beef to remove impurities. In a clean pot, boil just enough water to cover your beef and then add the beef and keep it boiling for 1-2 minutes. Remove the beef, rinse in clean water, cut into eating sized chunks. Discard the scummy water from this step."
- "Make spice ball by placing coriander, fennel, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, orange peel, Szechuan peppercorns, and bay leaves into a spice ball or spice bag."
- "In a wok or large pan over medium-high heat, pour in vegetable oil. Once heated, add the onions, garlic, chilis, scallions, ginger, rock sugar, apple, and bean pastes. Cook until the onions start to become translucent."
- "Add Shaoxing wine, allow some alcohol to cook off, then add soy sauces."
- "Add the sliced beef, spice ball, and tomatoes. Stir fry for about 10 minutes."
- "Go back to your beef bone stock and remove all the bones, then strain it into a large bowl to remove all the sediment at bottom of pot."
- "Combine beef bone stock and beef with braising liquid/spices/vegetables in a large pot. Simmer on low heat for at least 2 hours until flavours combine and meat is tender."
- "Check occasionally and skim off any scum on the top. When almost finished simmering, taste the broth and season. I usually add 2-4 tsp of MSG at this point."
- "Remove spice bag, or if you didn&#39;t use bag, remove the meat and tomatoes and then strain out the remaining solids. Add meat and tomatoes back to broth."
- "To serve, put light soy sauce, sesame oil, black vinegar, and ground white pepper in bottom of each bowl. Add broth and noodles, and top with chili oil, thinly sliced scallions, and lots of cilantro."
- "ENJOY!"
