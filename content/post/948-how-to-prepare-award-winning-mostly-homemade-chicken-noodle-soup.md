recipeinstructions:

- "Remove the chicken from the pot, let rest for 10 minutes."

- "During the last 8 or so minutes of simmering, add the egg noodles and a little more water, if needed. (As you can see in the picture, mine was lacking in liquid at the end so be mindful of that.)"
- "Remove from heat, serve immediately and enjoy the robust goodness!!"
