recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup aka red miso"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp sake Japanese rice wine"
- "2 medium eggplants  cut into 1 inch thick rounds"
- " 1 cup vegetable oil"
- "200 g ground chicken"
- "1 few pinches toasted sesame seeds optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the sauce:  Bring an inch of water to a boil in a small pot."
- "Combine the miso, sugar and 1/2 cup of the sake in a heatproof bowl that will fit in the small pot without touching the water and whisk until smooth."
- "Set the bowl in the pot and cook, stirring and scraping the side of the bowl occasionally until the sauce has thickened slightly and the colour has turned a shade darker, 15-20 minutes."
- "Set the bowl aside. In an airtight container, the sauce keep for up to 1 week in the fridge."
- "Make the dish:  Meanwhile, use a sharp knife to score both sides of the eggplant rounds every 1/4 inch or so in a crosshatched patter, going about 1/4 inch into the flesh."
- "Pour enough of the oil into a large nonstick skillet to reach a depth of 1/4 inch and set the skillet over medium heat until the oil shimmers. Add half of the eggplant and cook."
- "Flipping the rounds once, until both sides are deep golden brown, the eggplant is cooked through and some of the oil that the eggplant absorbed earlier releases back into the skillet, 8 to 10 minutes."
- "Transfer to a paper towel to drain. Repeat with the remaining eggplant. When all the eggplant is cooked, discard all but 2 tablespoons of the oil, if necessary."
- "Increase the heat to medium-high, add the chicken to the oil, and cook, stirring and breaking up clumps, until it‚Äôs just cooked through, about 3 minutes."
- "Add the remaining 2 tbsp sake and cook, stirring until any liquid in the pan has evaporated, about 2 minutes."
- "Take the skillet off the heat, stir in the miso sauce and set the skillet over the heat again just until the miso begins to bubble."
- "Divide the eggplant among plates and spoon on the miso sauce. Sprinkle on the sesame seeds and serve right away."
