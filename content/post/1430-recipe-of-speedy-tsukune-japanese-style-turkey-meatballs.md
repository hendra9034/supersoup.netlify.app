- "70 g panko breadcrumbs"
- "2 teaspoons pure sesame oil"
- "2 1/2 tablespoons light soya sauce"

- "2 tablespoons sesame oil"
- "6-7 bamboo skewers tepp gushi  gun skewer  narrow flat skewer with a handle"
- " Garnish"
- " Sprinkle Japanese chilli powder"
- " Sprinkle black or white sesame seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, place the mince meat along with the onion, garlic, ginger, spring onions, breadcrumbs, sesame oil, light soya sauce, honey, mirin and flour together. Using rubber gloves or chopsticks mix all of the ingredients together until well incorporated. Cover bowl with cling film and set aside for about 30 minutes to let the marinade infuse into the meat."
- "Once the meat has had time to marinade, prepare a baking tray or plate. Grab a small amount of meat (bite size) and roll into a ball shape. Repeat this until all of the meat has been used. Roughly makes 15 meatballs, so each skewer will have 3 pieces of meat on."
- "In a flat pan (either using big or small depending on how many your cooking), on medium heat add the oil. Add the meat balls and cook for a few minutes until lightly coloured. Then turn over to colour other side and then on both sides to brown. Keep continuously turning the meat balls to ensure the meat cook and colours evenly. Tip: if not cooking all at once separate the batches. The uncooked meatballs can be placed into a food container/freeze bag and be stored in the fridge/freezer."
- "Once the meat is fully cooked through, remove from the pan and transfer onto a plate or baking tray. Let the meat rest for a few minutes. Then poke the bamboo skewers into the meat balls (3 meatballs per skewer). Tip: I learnt this trick from Yui, to skewer the meat after its cooked, so the meat doesn&#39;t fall off during the cooking process."
- "Using the same pan turn the heat to low and add the meatball glaze ingredients. Using a wooden spoon stir the sauce to ensure that the honey or sugar dissolves. Taste the glaze and adjust as necessary (add more sugar, soya sauce, water, mirin etc)."
- "Once the glaze begins to thicken slightly and bubble, turn the heat to very low. Then place the skewered meatballs back into pan. Using a wooden spoon, generously cover the meatballs with the glaze all over. Let the meatballs soak in the glaze for a few minutes."
- "Once ready to serve, place the meatballs either on a serving plate and pour the glaze over. Or in a serving bowl, place the steamed rice at the bottom, place the meatballs skewers on top and drizzle over some of the glaze over the meat to soak into the rice. Then garnish with sesame seeds and Japanese chilli powder. Serve with a side of tamagoyaki egg, greens or pickled vegetables to cut through the sweetness."
