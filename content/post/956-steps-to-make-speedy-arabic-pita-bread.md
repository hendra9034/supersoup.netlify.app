recipeinstructions:
- "Add the sugar and yeast to a bowl and mix with 125ml of water then leave for about 5-10 minutes until you have bubbles formed on the surface"
- "Pour the yeast over 300g of plain flour with a pinch of salt and mix together to form a smooth dough. Cover and leave on the side for 30 minutes."
- "Roll out the dough and split it into around 10 parts, be sure to add some flour to the surface to stop it from sticking - each ball should be around 80g"
- "Cover the dough balls again for 10 minutes"
- "Using the rolling pin, roll the dough into a circular shape with a thickness of ~1cm"
- "Add the dough now on a preheated pan or under the grill in a preheated oven. Don‚Äôt touch or flip the bread until it completely puffs (if it‚Äôs in a pan wait until the bottom is brown and if you‚Äôre doing it in the oven then obviously flip the bread when the top is brown)"
- "Keep the bread covered with a clean towel while you work on the rest of the dough. This will keep the bread soft and nice.
