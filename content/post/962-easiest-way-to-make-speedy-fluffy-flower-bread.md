recipeinstructions:

- "Mix and then gradually add the flour. My dough needed exactly 550g but depending on your flour and eggs, it may require a bit less or a bit more. You need a dough that is soft and can be easily removed from the bowl (it won&#39;t stick)"
- "My bowl is big, so I leave the dough in there, cover with a cellophane and let it rise for 30-60 min, until it&#39;s double in volume."
- "Divide your dough in 4 pieces. Take the first one and roll it out into a circle, around 3mm thick. Spread some oil on it."
- "We do the same for the other 3 pieces, putting each one on top of the other. Roll out the dough, spread with oil, put on top of the previous one and continue. Don&#39;t put oil on top of the last one."
- "Place a circular cookie cutter in the middle, or a bowl, or a glass... Using a sharp knife, cut the dough from the glass to the edge of the circle into quarters. Cut each quarter in half to give you eight sections."
- "Take each section and twist it twice. Make sure you twist all the sections in the same direction"
- "Put it in your pan and let it rise again until double. Whisk an egg with a bit of water and brush the top of the bread with this. Sprinkle with some sesame seeds."
- "Bake in a preheated oven, 180ºC, until it gets a nice golden colour and if you knock it on the bottom you get a hollow sound (as if you knock on a door). About 40-50 min."
