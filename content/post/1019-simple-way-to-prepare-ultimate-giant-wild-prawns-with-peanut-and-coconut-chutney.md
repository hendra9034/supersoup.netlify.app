- "Cook the prawns on a not-too-hot barbecue, grilling them for 5-8 minutes on each side until they’re completely pink – if you’re using smaller prawns, 2-3 minutes on each side should do it."
- "Remove from the barbecue, scatter with chopped coriander and sprinkle with lemon juice, then serve at room temperature with the peanut chutney – and plenty of napkins."
