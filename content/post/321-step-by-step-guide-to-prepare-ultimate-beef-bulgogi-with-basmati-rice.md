recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the rice according to packet instructions, enough for the amount of people you&#39;re cooking for. Once ready, leave in the saucepan with the lid on."
- "Wash the green beans and cut them in half."
- "Peel and grate or finely chop the ginger and garlic."
- "Thinly slice the spring onions, keeping the white and greens separate."
- "Grate the apple with the skin on. Sorry about this bit, its hands down the worst part of cooking this dish. I get my husband to do a full bag of apples and then freeze in sandwich bags in two apple servings to use later, just defrost in the fridge overnight if you&#39;re doing this."
- "Combine the mince, ginger, garlic, spring onion whites, soy, sesame oil, apple and sugar in a bowl, I use my hands to get it properly mixed together."
- "Use a wide pan for the next bit, heat a small amount of oil and then add the beef mixture and the green beans.  Push it all down in to a massive fritter type thing. It should take around 5 minutes to brown. Carefully try and flip it over and do the same on the other side until it&#39;s cooked through and a bit crispy. I do it in four sections.   Don&#39;t worry if this is too difficult because you&#39;re going to be breaking it up in to chunks anyway."
- "Once the beef is cooked through, break it up in to chunks ready for serving with a wooden spoon."
- "Stir the green spring onions in to your rice and optionally add a small amount of sesame oil. Your rice and beef bulgogi are now ready to serve."
