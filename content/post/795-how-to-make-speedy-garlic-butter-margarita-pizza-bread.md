recipeinstructions:
- "24 hours before you make your pizza bread get your dough ready. This will make two pizzas - you can freeze one for another day or just double up on the other ingredients and make two straight away!"
- "In a large bowl add the flour then yeast to one side of the bowl, salt to the other side &amp; sugar in the middle. Add half the water and stir to mix in a little, pour the 3tbsp oil into the remaining water. Pour the rest of this mixture into the the dough and fold together. No needing, just give the dough a few squeezes to bring together - it will be sticky this is normal!"
- "Cover the dough &amp; leave at room temp for an hour. Take the dough from the bowl and knock back. Now, working from the top stretch the ball outwards and tuck under itself a few times - it should feel less sticky now. Put back in the bowl, cover again and pop in the fridge over night. - check out my Instagram pizza dough video in the highlight tab for help with this."
- "When ready to make your pizza, pre heat your oven to 240-250 degrees Celsius for at least 45 minutes!‚Ä¶needs to be searing hot ü•µ  While heating, take the dough and tear into 2 balls. Do the same stretching technique as before, the dough should now feel smooth and elastic. Pop the dough balls onto some grease proof paper and squish them into two flat disks. (You can freeze one now) Cover and leave to come up to room temperature for 20 minutes or so."
- "Now for the garlic butter. Combine the garlic, butter, virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt and oregano in a bowl. Microwave ‚Äòtil the butter melts and set aside."
- "Get your surface ready by sprinkling the semolina and a little flour on the dough. Press the dough down to shape, then roll out the dough turning it as you go (this stage takes some work as the dough is very elastic) once rolled out thinly (you can stretch it out if you prefer.) Place on some greaseproof then on a baking tray &amp; cover with a tea towel. Leave for 5 minutes."
- "Finally add the passata and spread evenly, sprinkle over the mozzarella, drizzle over most of the garlic butter (keep some for after baking) then get straight into the hot oven. It should take 8-10 minutes depending how thinly you roll your dough. It will bubble and blister in the oven."
- "Remove from the oven and brush the rest of the butter over the crust and top with some basil."
