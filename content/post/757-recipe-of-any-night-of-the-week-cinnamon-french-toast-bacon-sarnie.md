recipeingredient:
- "2 slices soft thinmedium sliced bread I used oatbarley bread"
- "2 smallmedium eggs beaten"
- "1 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "4-5 rashers smoked streaky bacon"
- "1 tbsp either chilli infused honey or maple syrup"
- " Icing sugar for dusting"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up a skillet over a medium high heat. Once hot add in the bacon and fry until beautifully crispy on both sides. The fat that comes out from the bacon is what we&#39;ll use to fry the bread. Once the bacon is done, remove and place upon kitchen towel to absorb the excess oil."
- "Add the cinnamon into the eggs and beat. Pour out onto a dinner plate. Take the bread and soak both sides in the egg. If there&#39;s too much bacon fat in the skillet, wipe some away then add in the soaked eggy bread. You may have to fry them individually if they don&#39;t both fit. Fry until the egg is cooked and it&#39;s mottled with brown spots and crisp at the edges."
- "Build the sandwich. Add the bacon onto one slice of the French toast then drizzle generously with chilli honey / maple syrup. Add the top slice then dust with icing sugar. Slice into halves and enjoy. :)"
