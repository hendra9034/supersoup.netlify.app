I was thinking of going with a sticky BBQ glaze for this and topping it. Maybe salmon marinated in kimchi brine? Salmon has already been marinaded with whatever kimchi you put so the furikake is just dry specs of dehydrated scallions and msg at this point. Place the kimchi, ginger, soy sauce, oil and vinegar in a small food processor and process until smooth.
