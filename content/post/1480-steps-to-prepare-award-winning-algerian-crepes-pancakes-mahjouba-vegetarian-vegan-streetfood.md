recipeingredient:
- " For the filling"
- "6 small red onions roughly chopped"
- "2 medium carrots chopped"
- "3 Hollan chillies more or less to taste"
- "1 1/2 cup my homemade tomato sauce 1 can whole peeled tomatoes and 3 tbs tomato paste"
- "2 tbs salt to taste"

- "1 tsp coconut sugar if the tomato is too citrusy"

- "2 table spoons olive oil or ghee more for greasing"
- " Crepe  Pancake Dough"
- "4 1/2 cups fine selmolina flour durum wheat"
- "2 cups water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine onions, chiles, and carrots in a food processor, and process until finely chopped. Heat oil in a 12″ skillet over medium-high heat. Add chopped vegetables, and cook, stirring, until soft and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Add tomato paste, and cook until lightly caramelized, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until mixture is thick and slightly dry, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro; let filling cool."
- "Meanwhile, combine 2 tbsp. salt, semolina, and 2 cups water in a bowl, and stir until dough forms. Transfer to a work surface, and knead until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky, about 8 minutes. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces, shape into balls, and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet; cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes."
- "Lightly oil a work surface (marble works best), and working one at a time, flatten dough ball into a disk using the heel of your hands until it is about 1⁄6” thick. Gently pull the edges to stretch the dough into a paper-thin rectangle, about 15″ long and 12″ wide. Place a scant 1⁄2 cup filling in the center of the dough, and spread it out to a 6″ x 4″ rectangle. Fold the long sides of the rectangle over the filling, and then fold over the short sides, pressing to seal and enclose the filling. R"
- "Heat a 12″ nonstick skillet over medium heat, place one packet seam side-down in skillet, and cook, flipping once, until browned in spots, about 12 minutes; repeat with remaining packets."
