recipeingredient:
- "45 g fresh mint leaves  thats 25 cups or as shown in my photo"
- "480 ml (2 cups) full fat coconut milk"
- "240 ml rice milk 1 cup"
- "200 g (1 cup) granulated sugar"
- "3 tbsp cornflour  corn starch"
- "1/2 tsp xanthan gum"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract or the seeds from 1 pod"
- " Vegan chocolate chips as required"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and pat dry the mint leaves and add to a saucepan with all of the milk"
- "Heat over a medium flame until bubbling around the edges, just about to boil - then stir, take off the heat, put a lid on the pan and let steep and infuse for 30 minutes"
- "Strain the mixture into another pan, squeezing as much liquid out of the mint leaves as possible before discarding them"
- "Mix together the sugar, cornflour and xanthan gum. (The cornflour helps thicken the plant milk and the xanthan gum is there to stop large ice crystals forming when the ice cream is in the freezer)"
- "Put the pan back over a medium heat and whisk in the sugar mixture. Keep mixing until simmering and thickened - around 2 minutes. Don&#39;t let the mixture boil, keep it moving"
- "Take off the heat and stir in the vanilla. Let cool to room temperature, whisking now and then to avoid a skin forming as this is essentially an eggless custard mixture"
- "Once cooled add in the choc chips - I had a bag of vegan &#39;Smarties&#39; to use which I broke up a bit with a ziploc bag and a rolling pin - then either churn in an ice cream maker for 20 minutes then put in the freezer overnight until set, or put in a metal container in the freezer and stir the mixture with a fork every 30 minutes for 2 hours, then let set overnight"
- "The ice cream will naturally have a slight green tinge from the mint leaves but feel free to add a dash of food colouring when churning if you&#39;d like a more commercial green colouring or you could use spiralina powder"
- "Take the container out of the freezer 20 minutes prior to serving and use a warmed scoop!"
