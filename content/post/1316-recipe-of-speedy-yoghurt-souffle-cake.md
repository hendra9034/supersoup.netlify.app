- "Turn off the oven. Leave the cake in the oven, with the door ajar for 1 hour, and cool slowly. When it is cool enough (room temperature), place in the fridge to chill in the tin. *Note: When you take out the cake straight away, the cake sinks just like the cake in the above photo.ðŸ˜“ It was supposed to look like the cake below."
- "Once the cake is chilled, it should be firm enough to flip using your hand. Gently peel the baking paper on the bottom, place it on the plate, then remove the paper on the sides."
