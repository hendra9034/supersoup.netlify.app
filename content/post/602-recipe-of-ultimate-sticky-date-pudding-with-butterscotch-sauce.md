What&#39;s not to like in a soft, spongy, airy, date pudding smothered in a thick and dark butterscotch sauce?? Comfort food at its best. + For a salted caramel sticky date pudding, add Â¼ teaspoon salt flakes to the butterscotch sauce. Sprinkle with extra salt to serve. + You can freeze the pudding (before saucing) - just wrap in non-stick baking paper and freeze in an airtight container for up to one month. The Sticky Date Pudding or Sticky Toffee Pudding should be served warm with the Butterscotch Sauce still bubbling from the stove, but as the cake keeps rather well over several days, it is also lovely served at room temperature with the warm sauce alongside.
