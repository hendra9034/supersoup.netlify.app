recipeingredient:
- "200 g fusilli casarecce pasta or close substitute shape"
- "2 banana shallots finely sliced into rings"
- " Soft creamy goats cheese around 60g"
- "3 whole cloves garlic peeled"
- " Extra virgin olive oil with black truffle to taste"
- " Cracked black pepper and salt to season extra salt for pasta"
- " Bacon fat for frying or use olive oil as alternative"
recipeinstructions:
- "Begin cooking the pasta according to packet instructions in salted boiling water. Heat a skillet over a medium low heat with a little bacon fat in. This will impart more flavour into the final dish, if I&#39;ve made bacon in the pan that morning, I&#39;ll save the fat for cooking with later. If you don&#39;t want to do this however, a glug of olive oil will suffice."
- "Add the sliced shallots and the garlic cloves. Fry the shallots gently until translucent and buttery soft and infused with a hint of garlic from the oil. Turn down the heat a little."
- "Once the pasta is beautifully al dente, remove and strain off most of the water, reserving a little then add it into the pan with the shallots. Gently toss everything together. Season well with black pepper and add a touch of salt. Remove the garlic cloves and discard."
- "Drizzle over a little truffle oil. Do this sparingly, to taste. I added around 1.5 tsp. The taste can be strong, so recommend adding a touch, tasting then adding a touch more if desired. Crumble in half the goats cheese. Stir through until it melts and coats the pasta."
- "Serve up and crumble over the remaining cheese. Season with extra pepper to taste if needed. Enjoy! :)"
