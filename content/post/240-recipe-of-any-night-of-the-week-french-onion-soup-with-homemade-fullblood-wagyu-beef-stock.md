- "Cover the roasted vegetables and Fullblood Wagyu soup bone with cold water, and put the crock pot lid on. Set the crock pot on low, and let it simmer for 12 hours. NOTE: Some crock pots only have an 8 hour low setting, so be sure to restart it for another 4 hours, so you have a total of 12 hours in the crock pot.After 12 hours, use a fine mesh sieve to strain off the Fullblood Wagyu beef stock, and reserve. Discard the bones and vegetables."
- "PREPARING THE SOUP Melt the unsalted butter and grapeseed oil in a large stainless steel pot over medium heat. Add the julienned sweet onions, kosher salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Cook, while stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom on the pan to pull up all the caramelization, until the onions are very soft and caramelized. This usually takes about 25 minutes.Add the wine, chopped garlic, sprigs of thyme, and bay leaves."
- "Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat.Simmer for about 5 minutes or until the wine has almost evaporated. Discard the thyme sprigs. Dust the onions with the all-purpose flour, and give them a stir. Turn the heat down to medium-low so the flour doesn’t burn. Cook for 5 minutes."
