recipeinstructions:
- "To make the chutney:   heat the oil in a pan and very gently fry the peanuts until golden – this will happen suddenly, so keep an eye on them to make sure they don’t burn. Remove from the heat and leave to cool."
- "Mix all the remaining chutney ingredients together and put in a blender or food processor. Whizz to a thick paste, taste and season, then set aside."
- "Light the barbecue. You don’t want to cook the prawns over a very fierce heat so adjust the grilling rack to raise it higher above the coals. De-vein the prawns using a very sharp knife that can cut through the shell and into the flesh but don’t remove the shell"
- "Mix together all the ingredients for the marinade, then rub it all over the prawns. Set them aside to marinate for 10 minutes."
- "Cook the prawns on a not-too-hot barbecue, grilling them for 5-8 minutes on each side until they’re completely pink – if you’re using smaller prawns, 2-3 minutes on each side should do it."
- "Remove from the barbecue, scatter with chopped coriander and sprinkle with lemon juice, then serve at room temperature with the peanut chutney – and plenty of napkins."
