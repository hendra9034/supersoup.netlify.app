recipeinstructions:
- "If you roast your own red peppers, get busy. I use jarred red peppers and drain in a colander."
- "Peel and roughly chop (we are gonna puree once cooked) carrots, potatoes and onions. If you use any canned vegetables, drain and rinse them off. I find that rinsing canned vegetables helps to improve the taste and removes the flavors of the canning process. If you think I&#39;ve lost my mind on this one that&#39;s ok too, but try it :)"
- "I had a crazy schedule so I threw vegetables, broth, tomatoes and seasonings in the crockpot on high until I was ready to puree. If you use a pot on the stove top, bring to a boil and reduce to simmer. Cooking time will depend on if you used canned or fresh but make sure you cook long enough to puree successfully."
- "Once all the veggies are fall apart soft or you return home from chaos......Puree until smooth, using either a stand or submersion blender. Salt and pepper to taste."
- "I store in the fridge and it&#39;s my delicious lunch for the week. Enjoy!"
