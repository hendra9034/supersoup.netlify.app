recipeingredient:
- "153 g allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1 g ground cinnamon"
- "138 g caster sugar"
- "75 g dark brown sugar"
- "212 g unsalted butter at room temperature"
- "1/2 vanilla bean split lengthwise"
- "1 egg"
- "134 g oldfashioned oats"

recipeinstructions:
- "Place the flour in a medium bowl, sift in the baking soda and cinnamon, and whisk together."
- "Whisk together the sugars in a small bowl, breaking up any lumps."
- "Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Turn to medium - low speed and cream the butter."
- "Warming the bowl of needed until it has the consistency of mayonnaise and holds a peak when the paddle is lifted."
- "Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean, add them to the butter mixture, and mix on low speed for about 30 seconds to distribute the seeds evenly, stopping to break up any larger pieces."
- "Add the eggs and mix low speed for 15-30 seconds, until just combine. Scape down the bowl again. The mixture may look broken but that is fine (over-whipping the egg could cause the cookies to expand too much during baking and then deflate)"
- "Add the combined dry ingredients in 2 additions, mixing on low speed for 15 to 30 seconds after each or just until combined. Scrape the bottom of the bowl to incorporate any dry ingredients that have settled there."

- "Pulse in the pecans. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes."
- "Position the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 160 degrees celsius (convection or standard). Line two sheet pans with silpats or parchment paper."
- "Using the ice cream scoop, divide the dough into 6 equal portions, 145 g each. Roll each one into a ball between the palms of your hands. (The dough can be shaped in advance)."
- "The cookies are very large; bake only 3 on each pan. With a short end of the pan toward you, place one cookie in the upper left corner, one in a lower left corner and the third one in the center toward the right side of the pan."
- "Bring the dough to room temperature before baking."
- "Bake until golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes in a convection oven. 18- 20 minutes in a standard oven."
- "Reversing the positions of the pans halfway through baking."
- "Set the pans on a cooling rack and cool for 5 to 10 minutes then transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely."
- "The cookies are best the day after they are baked, but they can be stored in a covered container for up to 3 days."
- "You will need a 2 1/2 inch ice cream scoop. Cookies baked in a convection over will have a more even colour and will not spread as much as those baked in a standard oven."
