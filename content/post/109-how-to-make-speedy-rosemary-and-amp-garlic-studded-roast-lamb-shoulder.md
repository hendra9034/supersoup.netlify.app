recipeinstructions:
- "Take the lamb joint out of any packaging and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes while you preheat the oven to 190 C."
- "Peel the garlic cloves and slice them into thick slices as shown below. You want them to be thick so that they are robust enough to push into the meat."
